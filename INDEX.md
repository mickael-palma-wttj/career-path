## 📚 Case Studies (5 Real-World Scenarios)

Learn from detailed, realistic scenarios with solutions.

1. **[The Stuck Senior Developer](CASE_STUDIES/The_Stuck_Senior_Developer.md)**
   - **Scenario:** High-performing Senior at level 3.5 years, not progressing
   - **Root cause:** Lack of clarity on Staff path, misconceptions about role
   - **Solution:** 12-month development plan with cross-team projects
   - **Outcome:** Successfully promoted to Staff
   - **Key lesson:** Most "stuck" developers lack clarity, not ability

2. **[Brilliant but Difficult](CASE_STUDIES/Brilliant_but_Difficult.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Exceptional technical skills, abrasive communication
   - **Root cause:** Lack of emotional intelligence, conflates directness with cruelty
   - **Solution:** 60-day behavior change plan with coaching
   - **Outcome:** Behavior transformation, team health restored
   - **Key lesson:** High technical competence doesn't excuse poor collaboration

3. **[The Management Question](CASE_STUDIES/The_Management_Question.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Senior IC asks about becoming a manager
   - **Root cause:** Feeling stuck, didn't understand Staff IC path existed
   - **Solution:** 3-month exploration of both IC and management paths
   - **Outcome:** Chose product-focused Staff IC path
   - **Key lesson:** Many ICs want advancement, not necessarily management

4. **[Promoted Too Early](CASE_STUDIES/Promoted_Too_Early.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Developer promoted to Senior before demonstrating readiness
   - **Root cause:** Previous manager lowered bar, left before supporting transition
   - **Solution:** 6-9 month scaffolding and skill development plan
   - **Outcome:** Grew into Senior role successfully
   - **Key lesson:** Can't undo promotion, but can help IC grow into role

5. **[The Retention Crisis](CASE_STUDIES/The_Retention_Crisis.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Top Staff engineer interviewing elsewhere, at risk of leaving
   - **Root causes:** Compensation gap, career ceiling, burnout, lack of recognition
