## 📚 Case Studies (10 Real-World Scenarios)

Learn from detailed, realistic scenarios with solutions.

### Original 5 Case Studies

1. **[The Stuck Senior Developer](CASE_STUDIES/The_Stuck_Senior_Developer.md)**
   - **Scenario:** High-performing Senior at level 3.5 years, not progressing
   - **Root cause:** Lack of clarity on Staff path, misconceptions about role
   - **Solution:** 12-month development plan with cross-team projects
   - **Outcome:** Successfully promoted to Staff
   - **Key lesson:** Most "stuck" developers lack clarity, not ability

2. **[Brilliant but Difficult](CASE_STUDIES/Brilliant_but_Difficult.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Exceptional technical skills, abrasive communication
   - **Root cause:** Lack of emotional intelligence, conflates directness with cruelty
   - **Solution:** 60-day behavior change plan with coaching
   - **Outcome:** Behavior transformation, team health restored
   - **Key lesson:** High technical competence doesn't excuse poor collaboration

3. **[The Management Question](CASE_STUDIES/The_Management_Question.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Senior IC asks about becoming a manager
   - **Root cause:** Feeling stuck, didn't understand Staff IC path existed
   - **Solution:** 3-month exploration of both IC and management paths
   - **Outcome:** Chose product-focused Staff IC path
   - **Key lesson:** Many ICs want advancement, not necessarily management

4. **[Promoted Too Early](CASE_STUDIES/Promoted_Too_Early.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Developer promoted to Senior before demonstrating readiness
   - **Root cause:** Previous manager lowered bar, left before supporting transition
   - **Solution:** 6-9 month scaffolding and skill development plan
   - **Outcome:** Grew into Senior role successfully
   - **Key lesson:** Can't undo promotion, but can help IC grow into role

5. **[The Retention Crisis](CASE_STUDIES/The_Retention_Crisis.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Top Staff engineer interviewing elsewhere, at risk of leaving
   - **Root causes:** Compensation gap, career ceiling, burnout, lack of recognition
   - **Solution:** Comprehensive retention package (comp, growth path, new projects)
   - **Outcome:** Stayed, promoted to Senior Staff as planned
   - **Key lesson:** Retention requires addressing root causes, not just money

### New 5 Case Studies

6. **[The High Performer with Low Soft Skills](CASE_STUDIES/The_High_Performer_with_Low_Soft_Skills.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Technical genius (3.5+ rating) but poor collaboration (2.0 soft skills)
   - **Root causes:** Technical trajectory bias, lack of feedback, defensive posture, role misunderstanding
   - **Solution:** 3-phase approach over 6 months (conversation → diagnosis → implementation + support)
   - **Outcome:** Soft skills improved 2.0→3.0, overall 2.8→3.1, Staff consideration approved
   - **Key lesson:** Technical brilliance without soft skills has a ceiling; respect strengths while building gaps

7. **[The Imposter Syndrome Trap](CASE_STUDIES/The_Imposter_Syndrome_Trap.md)**
   - **Scenario:** Capable Senior (objectively 3.1) paralyzed by self-doubt (self-rates 2.2)
   - **Root causes:** Attribution bias, internalized doubts, avoidance behaviors, visibility gap
   - **Solution:** 4-phase approach (reality check with data → naming pattern → evidence building → action)
   - **Outcome:** Self-rating improved 2.2→2.8, promoted to Staff track, retention improved
   - **Key lesson:** Data beats opinion; naming patterns and shared language empower high performers

8. **[The Burnout Risk](CASE_STUDIES/The_Burnout_Risk.md)**
   - **Scenario:** High performer (3.2 rating) heading toward collapse from overwork
   - **Root causes:** Reliability trap, systemic understaffing, perfectionist personality, no circuit breaker
   - **Solution:** 5-phase approach (wake-up call → assessment → workload reset → recovery → prevention)
   - **Outcome:** Normalized hours and well-being, performance maintained, systemic changes implemented
   - **Key lesson:** Burnout is a management and resource planning failure; prevent through active monitoring

9. **[The Equity Gap](CASE_STUDIES/The_Equity_Gap.md)**
   - **Scenario:** High performer discovers 20-25% pay gap to market
   - **Root causes:** Company hiring practices, gradual raises not keeping pace, market changes, no audits
   - **Solution:** Immediate substantial adjustment + systemic compensation audit + transparency
   - **Outcome:** Salary adjusted to market, systemic fixes implemented, trust partially restored
   - **Key lesson:** Fair compensation is retention issue; address gaps quickly with data and business case

10. **[The Comeback Story](CASE_STUDIES/The_Comeback_Story.md)**
    - **Scenario:** Strong performer returning from 6-month parental leave struggling to re-engage
    - **Root causes:** Changed codebase, identity shift, life circumstances (sleep deprivation), no re-entry plan
    - **Solution:** Deliberate re-entry (knowledge transfer → team integration → confidence building → momentum)
    - **Outcome:** Full re-engagement within 6 weeks, career trajectory maintained, parental leave normalized
    - **Key lesson:** Returns from leave require deliberate manager support; small investments pay off in retention
