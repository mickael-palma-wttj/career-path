## 💡 Tips for Creating Effective PIPs

### For Managers

**Be Specific and Objective:**
✅ "PRs require 4-6 revisions; team average is 1-2"

✅ "Misses 30% of team meetings"
❌ "Not committed to the team"

**Make Goals Achievable:**
- Goals should be challenging but realistic
- Provide adequate support and resources
- Consider if timeframe is reasonable

**Document Everything:**
- Keep detailed notes of all conversations
- Save emails, Slack messages, examples
- Track progress objectively
- This protects both you and the employee

**Be Consistent:**
- Apply standards equally across team
- Don't wait too long to start PIP
- Follow through on stated consequences

**Partner with HR:**
- Get HR review before issuing PIP
- Keep HR updated on progress
- Consult HR before any final decisions

### Common PIP Mistakes

❌ **Too Vague:**
"Improve performance" isn't specific enough

❌ **Unrealistic Goals:**
Expecting complete transformation in 30 days

❌ **No Support:**
Demanding improvement without providing resources

❌ **Not Documented:**
Starting PIP without documentation of prior issues

❌ **Inconsistent Application:**
Using PIP for one person but not others with similar issues

❌ **No HR Involvement:**
Creating PIP without HR review (legal risk!)

❌ **Moving Too Fast:**
Skipping informal coaching and going straight to PIP
