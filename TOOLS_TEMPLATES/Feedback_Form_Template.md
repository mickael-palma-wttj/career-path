## TEMPLATE TIPS

**Making it work:**
1. Keep it 10-15 minutes max (people more likely to respond)
2. Mix question types (keeps it interesting)
3. Use open-ended for depth, Likert for patterns
4. Be specific about context (why collecting, how using)
5. Emphasize confidentiality/anonymity

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Too long (people don't complete)
- ❌ Too vague (feedback hard to use)
- ❌ Too harsh/accusatory tone
- ❌ Not enough context (feedback providers confused)
- ❌ Using single negative comment as evidence

**What works:**
- ✓ Specific, clear questions
- ✓ Mix of scales and open-ended
- ✓ Clear purpose and confidentiality
- ✓ Reasonable length
- ✓ Multiple feedback providers (3-7 minimum)
