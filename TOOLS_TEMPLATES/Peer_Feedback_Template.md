**Subject:** Feedback to Help [Name] Grow

## 💡 Tips for Requesting Peer Feedback

### For Managers

**Choose the Right People:**
- Direct collaborators (worked together on specific projects)
- Cross-functional partners (PM, design, other teams)
- People at different levels (peers, senior folks, ICs they've mentored)
- Mix of close collaborators and occasional partners
- Aim for 5-8 people for promotions, 3-5 for regular reviews

**Timing Matters:**
- Ask early (at least 1 week before you need it)
- Don't ask during busy periods (end of quarter, launches)
- Request soon after projects end while details are fresh

**Make It Easy:**
- Be specific about what you need
- Provide context on how it will be used
- Show examples of good feedback
- Give a clear deadline
- Make submission easy (form, email, whatever works)

**Follow Up:**
- Send reminder 2-3 days before deadline
- Thank people when they submit
- Share outcome if appropriate ("Thanks for your input—Sarah got promoted!")

---

### For ICs (Self-Collecting)

**Ask Strategically:**
- Focus on recent collaborations
- Include people whose opinion you value
- Mix of people who've seen different aspects of your work
- Don't only ask friends—seek diverse perspectives

**Be Genuine:**
- Express authentic desire to grow
- Make it clear you want honesty, not flattery
- Show how you'll use the feedback
- Thank people sincerely

**Time It Right:**
- After successful projects
- Before review cycles or promotion discussions
- When planning development goals
- After reaching milestones

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Vague Requests:**
❌ "Tell me what you think about Sarah"
✅ "Share specific examples of Sarah's technical leadership on Project X"

**No Context:**
❌ "I need feedback on Tom"
✅ "I'm building Tom's promotion case to Senior—what leadership have you seen from him?"

**Too Close to Deadline:**
❌ "I need this tomorrow"
✅ "Please submit by [1 week from now]"

**No Examples:**
❌ Just ask questions
✅ Show what good feedback looks like

**Too Many Questions:**
❌ 15 detailed questions
✅ 3-4 focused questions

**Not Following Up:**
❌ Request then silence
✅ Thank people and share outcomes

---

## ✅ Quality Check: Good vs. Poor Feedback

### ⭐ High-Quality Feedback

**Characteristics:**
- Specific examples and situations
- Describes behaviors and impact
- Balanced (strengths and growth areas)
- Actionable (person can do something with it)
- Evidence-based (observable facts, not assumptions)

**Example:**
"Maria led the API redesign project where she coordinated across 3 teams. She ran effective technical syncs, documented decisions clearly, and made thoughtful trade-offs between performance and maintainability. When Backend team had concerns, she scheduled a deep-dive session and found a solution everyone supported. One area for growth: earlier escalation when timelines slip—we learned about a 2-week delay only 1 week before the original deadline. Overall, excellent technical leadership and collaboration."

---

### ❌ Poor-Quality Feedback

**Characteristics:**
- Generic and vague
- No specific examples
- Only positive or only negative
- Not actionable
- Based on assumptions, not observations

**Example:**
"Maria is a good engineer and nice to work with. She does quality work."

---

## 🎯 Feedback Quality Guide for Responders

### If You're Asked for Feedback

**Do This:**

✅ **Be Specific**
Include project names, situations, timeframes

✅ **Describe Behaviors**
What they did, said, or created

✅ **Explain Impact**
How their actions affected you, the team, or outcomes

✅ **Balance Positive and Constructive**
Strengths + growth areas when appropriate

✅ **Stay Factual**
Describe what you observed, not what you assume about their motivations

✅ **Be Actionable**
Give feedback they can actually use

---

**Avoid This:**

❌ **Generic Statements**
"Great engineer" tells nothing

❌ **Personality Judgments**
Focus on behaviors, not character

❌ **Comparing to Others**
"Better than Alex" isn't helpful

❌ **Assumptions**
"They probably think..." Stick to what you observed

❌ **Punitive Tone**
Be constructive, not harsh
