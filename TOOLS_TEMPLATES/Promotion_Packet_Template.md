## 💡 Tips for Strong Promotion Packets

### Do's ✅

**Be Specific:**
"Led 3 cross-team projects" not "does leadership work"

**Quantify Impact:**
"Reduced latency 60%, saving $50K annually" not "improved performance"

**Show Consistency:**
"Over 8 months, led 4 projects..." not "did one impressive thing"

**Use Peer Voice:**
Direct quotes are more powerful than your paraphrasing

**Connect to Business:**
Show how their work matters to company goals

**Address Weaknesses:**
If there's a gap, acknowledge and explain

---

### Don'ts ❌

**Don't Be Vague:**
"Great engineer" tells reviewers nothing

**Don't Exaggerate:**
Be honest—exaggeration hurts credibility

**Don't Focus Only on Technical:**
Need evidence in all three pillars

**Don't Make It About Time:**
"They've been here X years" isn't evidence

**Don't Ignore Standards:**
Must demonstrate criteria for next level

**Don't Submit Without Review:**
Have someone else read it first
