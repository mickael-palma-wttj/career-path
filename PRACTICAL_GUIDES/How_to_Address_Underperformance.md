# How to Address Underperformance

A practical guide to identifying, addressing, and resolving performance issues with clear steps and compassionate approach.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Addressing underperformance is one of the hardest parts of management. It's uncomfortable but essential. Done well, you can help someone improve. Done poorly, you can damage trust and create legal risk.

**Key principles:**
- Address issues early before they compound
- Be direct and specific, not vague
- Separate the person from the performance
- Focus on observable behaviors and impact
- Provide clear path to improvement
- Document everything
- Be compassionate but firm

---

## 🚦 Recognizing Underperformance

### What is Underperformance?

**Performance that doesn't meet expectations for their level:**
- Missing deadlines consistently
- Quality of work below standards
- Not demonstrating expected skills
- Negative impact on team
- Not responsive to feedback
- Behaviors that violate team norms

**What is NOT underperformance:**
- Making mistakes while learning (expected for level)
- Having a bad week
- Different working style
- Not being "rockstar" performer
- Not ready for promotion (that's not the same as underperforming)

---

## 📊 The Underperformance Response Framework

### Stage 1: Early Concerns (Informal)

**What it is:** Recent pattern of concerning behavior, but not yet sustained

**Duration:** 2-4 weeks of observation

**Your actions:**
- Notice the pattern
- Give immediate feedback
- Check if there are external factors
- Clarify expectations
- Provide support

**Example:** "I've noticed your last two PRs needed significant rework. That's unusual for you. What's going on?"

---

### Stage 2: Performance Coaching (Semi-Formal)

**What it is:** Pattern is sustained (4-6 weeks), previous feedback hasn't changed behavior

**Duration:** 4-6 weeks of focused coaching

**Your actions:**
- Dedicated conversation about performance
- Clear expectations and examples
- Written goals for improvement
- Weekly check-ins
- Support and resources
- Document conversations

**Example:** "We need to talk about your performance. Over the past 6 weeks, I've seen [specific examples]. This doesn't meet expectations for your level. Let's create a plan to address this."

---

### Stage 3: Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) (Formal)

**What it is:** Performance coaching didn't work, formal intervention needed

**Duration:** 30-90 days (typically 60)

**Your actions:**
- Written PIP document
- Very specific expectations
- Clear timeline
- Frequent check-ins (usually weekly)
- HR involvement
- Documented progress
- Clear consequences

**Example:** "Despite our coaching over the past 2 months, I haven't seen sufficient improvement. We're moving to a formal Performance Improvement Plan."

---

### Stage 4: Termination or Role Change

**What it is:** PIP didn't result in acceptable improvement

**Your actions:**
- Work with HR and legal
- Termination conversation
- Or explore alternative: different role, demotion, transfer
- Exit process

---

## 🗣️ Step-by-Step: The Performance Coaching Conversation

### Before the Meeting

**1. Gather evidence (1-2 hours)**
- Specific examples with dates
- Observable behaviors and impact
- Patterns over time
- Previous feedback given
- Expected standards for their level

**2. Consult with HR (30 minutes)**
- Review your concerns
- Ensure you're being fair
- Understand company process
- Get guidance on approach

**3. Prepare your talking points**
- Specific examples ready
- Clear gap between expected and actual
- Focus on behavior, not character
- Path forward in mind

**4. Schedule the meeting**
- Private setting
- Enough time (45-60 minutes)
- Not end of day Friday
- Give them slight heads-up: "I want to discuss some performance concerns"

---

### During the Meeting: The Structure

**Part 1: State the Purpose (2 minutes)**

Be direct and clear:
"Thank you for making time. I want to talk about some performance concerns I've been observing. This is a serious conversation about your work not meeting expectations."

**Don't:**
- Start with small talk
- Bury the lead
- Be vague about seriousness

---

**Part 2: Present Specific Examples (10 minutes)**

Use structure: Expectation → What Happened → Impact

**Example:**
"As a [level], the expectation is [X]. Over the past [timeframe], here's what I've observed:

1. [Specific example 1 with date]: [Behavior] → [Impact]
2. [Specific example 2 with date]: [Behavior] → [Impact]  
3. [Specific example 3 with date]: [Behavior] → [Impact]

This pattern doesn't meet expectations for your level."

**Be specific:**
❌ "Your code quality is bad"
✅ "In the past month, 4 of your 5 PRs required major rework due to missing test coverage and logic errors, delaying releases by 2 weeks"

❌ "You're not communicating well"
✅ "You've missed 3 standup meetings without notice, haven't provided status updates on your project in 2 weeks, and stakeholders have come to me asking where things stand"

---

**Part 3: Listen to Their Perspective (10 minutes)**

**Ask:** "What's your perspective on this?"

**Listen for:**
- Do they acknowledge the issues?
- Are there factors you're unaware of?
- Are they defensive or receptive?
- Do they understand the seriousness?

**Acknowledge what you hear:**
"I hear that [X has been challenging for you]."
"I understand [personal situation]."

**But be clear:**
"While I understand the circumstances, the performance gap still needs to be addressed."

---

**Part 4: Clarify Expectations (10 minutes)**

**Be very specific about what needs to change:**

"Going forward, here's what I need to see:

1. **[Specific behavior 1]:** [Exactly what it looks like]
   - Success looks like: [Measurable criteria]
   
2. **[Specific behavior 2]:** [Exactly what it looks like]
   - Success looks like: [Measurable criteria]

3. **[Specific behavior 3]:** [Exactly what it looks like]
   - Success looks like: [Measurable criteria]"

**Example:**
"For code quality: Every PR must include comprehensive tests with >80% coverage, follow our style guide, and pass linting before requesting review. Success = <2 blocking comments per PR."

---

**Part 5: Support and Timeline (10 minutes)**

**Offer support:**
"Here's how I'll support you:
- [Resources, training, mentoring]
- [Adjustments to workload]
- [Regular check-ins]"

**Set timeline:**
"We'll check in weekly for the next 6 weeks. I need to see consistent improvement within 4 weeks and sustained performance at expectations by week 6.

If I don't see sufficient improvement, we'll need to move to a more formal process or discuss whether this role is the right fit."

**Be clear about seriousness:**
"I want to be direct: if performance doesn't improve, your job is at risk. I'm telling you this because I want you to succeed, and I need you to understand the seriousness."

---

**Part 6: Check Understanding and Close (5 minutes)**

**Ask:**
- "Do you understand what I'm asking?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "Do you think these expectations are fair?"
- "How are you feeling about this?"

**Acknowledge:**
"I know this is difficult feedback. My goal is to help you succeed."

**Commit:**
"I'll send you a written summary of what we discussed. Let's meet next week to check on progress."

## ⚠️ Common Scenarios & How to Handle

### Scenario 1: External Personal Issues

**Situation:** IC is underperforming due to health, family, or personal issues.

**Approach:**
- Show compassion
- Explore accommodations (flex hours, time off, reduced workload)
- Be clear: while you understand, standards still apply
- Work with HR on accommodations
- Set realistic timeline given circumstances
- Consider leave of absence if needed

**Example:**
"I understand you're going through a difficult time with [situation]. Let's talk about what accommodations would help. [Discuss options]. At the same time, I need to be clear that the performance expectations remain, though we can adjust the timeline and workload. Does [accommodation] help you meet those expectations?"

---

### Scenario 2: Defensive Response

**Situation:** IC denies issues, blames others, gets angry.

**Approach:**
- Stay calm and factual
- Bring conversation back to specifics
- Acknowledge feelings but hold boundary
- Don't get drawn into argument
- Reiterate expectations

**Example:**
"I hear that you disagree with my assessment. Let me share the specific examples... [Facts]. These are observable behaviors and their impact. I need you to focus on what's within your control to change. Can we discuss how to address these specific issues?"

---

### Scenario 3: Promises to Improve (But Doesn't)

**Situation:** IC agrees to everything, says they'll improve, but behavior doesn't change.

**Approach:**
- Weekly check-ins with specific evidence
- Call out the gap between words and actions
- Move to more formal stage faster
- Be very clear about consequences

**Example:**
"In our last conversation, you committed to [X]. This week, I observed [Y, which doesn't match]. I need to see follow-through, not just agreement. If I don't see actual behavior change by next week, we'll need to move to a formal PIP."

---

### Scenario 4: Sudden Improvement, Then Regression

**Situation:** IC improves during coaching, then slides back.

**Approach:**
- Name the pattern
- Extend observation period
- Clarify need for sustained performance
- May need formal PIP to create accountability

**Example:**
"I've noticed a pattern: you improved for 2 weeks, then performance dropped again. I need sustained improvement, not temporary. We'll continue weekly check-ins for 2 more weeks to ensure the improvement sticks."

---

### Scenario 5: Wrong Role/Level

**Situation:** Person is trying hard but not capable at this level.

**Approach:**
- Acknowledge effort
- Be honest about fit
- Explore alternative: demotion, different role, different team
- If no alternatives, may need to exit

**Example:**
"I see you're working hard, and I appreciate the effort. However, I'm not seeing the capability at [level] that we need. Let's discuss whether a different role might be a better fit, or whether this company is the right place for where you are in your career."

## 💔 When Performance Doesn't Improve

### Making the Decision

**Assess after PIP period:**
- Have they met the success criteria?
- Has behavior sustainably changed?
- Do you believe they can maintain this level?
- Would you be comfortable removing the PIP?

**Options:**

**1. Success - Remove PIP**
Clear improvement, meeting expectations consistently.
"Congratulations, you've met the PIP requirements. We'll continue to monitor, but you're no longer on formal PIP."

**2. Partial Improvement - Extend PIP**
Some improvement but not sufficient.
"I've seen improvement in [X], but [Y] still needs work. We're extending the PIP for 30 more days focused on [Y]."

**3. No Improvement - Terminate or Transition**
Hasn't met expectations.
"Despite the PIP and support provided, performance hasn't improved sufficiently. We'll be transitioning you out of the role."

---

### The Termination Conversation

**Work with HR first:**
- Ensure all documentation in order
- Follow company process
- Understand legal considerations
- Prepare severance/logistics

**The conversation (10-15 minutes):**

**1. Be direct (1 minute)**
"Thank you for meeting. I have difficult news. We've decided to end your employment, effective [date]."

**2. Brief explanation (2 minutes)**
"As we discussed in your PIP, despite our coaching and support, your performance hasn't improved to meet expectations. [Brief 1-2 sentence summary]. This decision is final."

**3. Logistics (5 minutes)**
"Here's what happens next: [Logistics provided by HR]
- Last day, severance, benefits, etc."

**4. Acknowledge and close (2 minutes)**
"I know this is difficult news. [HR rep] will walk you through next steps."

**Don't:**
- Debate the decision
- Rehash all the details
- Make it longer than needed
- Apologize excessively
- Offer false hope

**Remember:** Addressing underperformance is hard but necessary. Do it with directness, compassion, and fairness. Give people a real chance to improve with clear expectations and support. Document everything. And if it doesn't work out, help them exit with dignity. Your job is to be fair and clear, not to be liked.
