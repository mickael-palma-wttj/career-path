## Remote Work Context

### Remote, Hybrid, Distributed

**Full remote:**
- Everyone works from home/distributed locations
- No office hub
- Timezone differences likely
- All communication mediated through tools

**Hybrid:**
- Some days office, some days remote
- Often uneven presence (some in office more)
- Can create in-office bias
- Flexibility and logistical challenges

**Distributed:**
- Across multiple geographies/timezones
- Few or no shared office locations
- Intentional remote-first practices
- Async-first communication

**This guide applies to all three** with adaptations noted.

## Unique Challenges

### The Visibility Challenge

**In-office default:**
- Manager can see work happening
- Informal conversations about projects
- Overhearing what people are working on
- Casual mentorship moments
- Presence signals engagement

**Remote reality:**
- Only see what's explicitly shared
- No ambient awareness of work
- Miss informal learning moments
- Must be intentional about presence
- Quiet doesn't mean disengaged

**Impact on development:**
- Hard to spot readiness for next level
- Unclear how ICs spend their time
- Missed mentorship opportunities
- Harder to build relationships
- Performance can be invisible

**Solutions:**
- Intentional visibility practices
- Regular check-ins (more frequent than in-office)
- Explicit status sharing
- Show-and-tell sessions
- Async documentation of work

### The Relationship Challenge

**In-office default:**
- Relationships built casually and often
- Trust develops through proximity
- Mentorship happens organically
- Team bonds through shared space
- Difficult conversations sometimes easier in person

**Remote reality:**
- Relationships require intentional effort
- Trust must be built deliberately
- Mentorship must be scheduled
- Team bonding happens through activities
- Difficult conversations harder without presence

**Impact on development:**
- Weaker manager-IC relationships
- Less peer mentorship
- Harder to give difficult feedback
- Career conversations feel more formal
- People feel less supported

**Solutions:**
- Regular 1:1s are critical
- Team rituals and bonding
- Mentor relationships formalized
- Feedback culture more explicit
- Growth opportunities more visible

### The Async Challenge

**In-office default:**
- Real-time decision-making common
- Quick questions answered immediately
- Collaboration happens synchronously
- Meetings are in-person
- Response expectations immediate

**Remote reality:**
- Many decisions must be async
- Wait for responses across timezones
- Collaboration tools mediate interaction
- Meetings are deliberate, not casual
- Can't expect immediate response

**Impact on development:**
- Career conversations take longer
- Feedback cycles slower
- Less real-time coaching
- Development planning more formal
- Harder to course-correct quickly

**Solutions:**
- Async-first communication
- Clear response time expectations
- Written documentation of decisions
- Intentional real-time moments
- Patience with slower feedback loops

### The Timezone Challenge (Distributed)

**Coordination difficulty:**
- Finding meeting times hard
- Some people always inconvenienced
- Async becomes necessity
- Meeting recording and follow-up needed
- Some people left out of real-time moments

**Impact on development:**
- Hard to do real-time coaching
- Feedback conversations challenging
- Team bonding harder
- Career advancement may feel unfair (some managers accessible, some not)

**Solutions:**
- Rotating meeting times
- Strong async practices
- Written decisions and outcomes
- Intentional inclusion practices
- Clear availability expectations

## Visibility & Awareness

### Intentional Status Sharing

**What to implement:**

**Weekly status updates:**
```
# What I accomplished this week
- [Project/work]
- [Project/work]

# What I'm working on next week
- [Project/work]
- [Project/work]

# Blockers/help needed
- [If any]

# Learning/wins
- [Something I learned or did well]
```

**Benefits:**
- Manager sees full picture of work
- Other team members know what's happening
- ICs reflect on their contributions
- Accomplishments become visible
- Creates equity (everyone's work seen)

**Format options:**
- Slack channel (daily or weekly)
- Email to manager
- Document updated weekly
- Shared spreadsheet
- Tool with built-in status (Lattice, etc.)

### Work-in-Progress Visibility

**Create visibility into ongoing work:**

**Project tracking:**
- Shared roadmap visible to all
- Project management tool updated regularly
- Progress visible in real-time (not just when done)
- Blockers captured and visible

**Code/work artifacts:**
- Design documents shared
- Code review process public
- Demos/presentations recorded
- Writing/documentation shared
- Creating artifacts people can learn from

**Benefits:**
- Manager sees development work happening
- ICs get recognition for in-progress work
- Team members can learn from each other
- Readiness for next level becomes visible
- Mistakes caught earlier

### Learning Artifacts

**Create artifacts that show learning:**

**Documentation:**
- How-to guides for tasks they complete
- Learnings from projects
- Process documentation
- Technical write-ups

**Knowledge sharing:**
- Brown bag presentations
- Blog posts or internal articles
- Mentoring notes
- Code comments explaining decisions

**Portfolio building:**
- Collect all artifacts
- Create portfolio of accomplishments
- Useful for promotions/job transitions
- Shows growth over time

## Virtual 1:1 Best Practices

### Frequency & Duration

**Remote baseline:**
- Weekly 1:1s are minimum (vs. bi-weekly in-office)
- 30-45 minutes typical
- More frequent if development/performance issues
- Same time weekly (builds routine)
- Calendar protected (hard to reschedule)

**In-person equivalent:**
- Weekly remote ≈ bi-weekly in-office
- Remote needs more intentionality

### 1:1 Structure

**Opening (5 min):**
- How are you doing? (genuine ask)
- Catch up briefly
- Set agenda for meeting

**Manager follow-up (5 min):**
- How's [project] going?
- Any blockers I should know about?
- Anything from me you need?

**IC agenda (15 min):**
- What are you thinking about?
- How's development plan going?
- Any concerns or questions?
- Do they have agenda items?

**Coaching/development (10 min):**
- Work on specific challenge
- Discuss feedback received
- Plan next steps
- Problem-solve together

**Closing (5 min):**
- Recap action items
- Check in on wellbeing
- Next week's focus

### Virtual Meeting Tips

**Technical setup:**
- Quiet location (if possible)
- Camera on (builds connection)
- No multitasking
- Full screen focus on each other
- Good internet connection
- Minimize distractions

**Presence and connection:**
- Start by connecting as people first
- Ask real questions (not just transactional)
- Pay attention to tone/mood
- Pick up on subtle cues
- Show genuine interest

**Documentation:**
- Take notes during call
- Share notes with IC after
- Track patterns over time
- Reference in follow-ups
- Useful for manager continuity

### Hybrid 1:1 Considerations

**If you're sometimes in office:**
- Be intentional: Is this meeting in-person or remote?
- Don't do in-person from office with IC at home (power imbalance)
- If IC in office, meet in person
- If IC remote, do video call even if you're in office
- Consistency matters for connection

## Career Conversations Remote

### Additional Challenges

**Remote makes it harder to:**
- Have spontaneous career conversations
- Read non-verbal cues
- Build trust for vulnerable conversations
- Feel psychological safety
- Have "off the record" chats
- Assess readiness through informal observation

### Making It Work

**Intentional scheduling:**
- Schedule "career conversation" 1:1s specifically
- Different from regular check-in
- Separate from performance feedback
- Give IC heads up: "Let's talk about your career next week"
- Allow time for thoughtful conversation

**Building safety:**
- Be honest about what you see/don't see remote
- "I can't see everything—help me understand"
- Ask open questions
- Listen more than talk
- No judgement for uncertainties
- Take notes to show you care

**Creating presence:**
- Video on for these conversations
- Find quiet space
- Minimize distractions
- Full attention
- Make it feel special/important

### Career Conversation Flow Remote

**Kickoff:**
- "Let's talk about your career"
- "I'm interested in understanding where you want to go"
- "No pressure, just want to support your growth"

**Exploration:**
- "What's energizing you right now?"
- "What are you curious about?"
- "Where do you want to be in 2 years?"
- "What's getting in your way?"

**My perspective:**
- "From what I've observed (or haven't observed remotely)..."
- Share what you see their strengths are
- Be honest about gaps/visibility
- Offer your read on their readiness

**Planning:**
- "If you want to move toward X, what would help?"
- "Let's create a development plan"
- "Here's what I can support"
- "Let's check in quarterly on this"

### Asynchronous Career Conversations

**When to use:**
- Timezone differences extreme
- Initial exploration
- Follow-up on verbal conversation
- Written input wanted

**Written template:**
```
Hi [IC],

Wanted to put some thoughts in writing about your career 
growth. A few observations from working with you:

[Strengths/what you see]
[Areas of growth/opportunities]
[Your read on next steps]

I'm curious—what are you thinking about for your career? 
Let's grab a call to discuss and create a plan together.

Looking forward to talking more.
```

**Benefits:**
- Gives IC time to think
- Creates record
- Spans timezones
- IC can prepare thoughts
- More thoughtful than rushed meeting

## Feedback in Remote Settings

### General Feedback Challenges

**Remote makes it harder to:**
- Provide real-time feedback (no casual moments)
- Catch small things early
- Read whether feedback landed
- Gauge emotional impact
- Follow up naturally

### Real-Time Feedback Remote

**What to do:**
- Schedule time: "Got some feedback for you"
- Use video (not Slack)
- Have dedicated time
- Explain the what/why
- Check in on impact
- Follow up later

**Example:**
"Hey, want to talk about that meeting? I noticed 
[specific behavior]. I think [impact]. Want to talk about it?"

### Recorded Feedback

**For complex feedback:**
- Record a video message
- Lets you get tone right
- IC can watch in private
- Can replay/process
- Follow up in person

**Benefits:**
- Non-verbal cues present
- Softer than written
- Easier to understand tone
- Creates record
- IC controls when they receive it

### Written Feedback Considerations

**Advantages:**
- Gives IC time to process
- Can be more precise
- Creates record
- Spans timezones
- IC's response thoughtful

**Challenges:**
- Harder to read tone
- Can feel harsh
- Miss non-verbal softening
- IC may misinterpret
- Harder to discuss real-time

**Best practice for written:**
- Use in addition to conversation, not instead
- Written summary after verbal conversation
- Use warm tone
- Include context and why you're sharing
- Invite discussion
- Follow up

### 360 Feedback Remote

**Additional tips:**
- More important than in-office
- Helps with visibility gaps
- Need more feedback providers (to see fuller picture)
- Take extra care with anonymity
- Share results with extra context
- More follow-up conversation needed

---

## Promotion Assessment Remote

### Visibility Challenge

**The core problem:**
- Hard to see if someone is truly ready for next level
- Fewer informal demonstrations of capability
- Have to rely on what IC explicitly shows you
- Other perspectives even more important
- Risk of visibility bias (people who speak up more seem ready)

### Building Evidence Remote

**Focus on:**

**Demonstrated capability:**
- Successfully led projects/initiatives
- Technical depth in challenging areas
- Decision-making quality
- Problem-solving approach

**Peer feedback:**
- Particularly important remote
- Shows cross-team impact
- Reveals collaboration style
- More credible than manager observation alone

**Artifacts:**
- Design documents
- Code reviews/contributions
- Written analyses
- Documentation
- Portfolio of work

**Stretch project performance:**
- Take on assignments beyond current level
- Visible performance on those
- Shows capacity for growth

### Remote Promotion Assessment Process

**Step 1: Build artifact collection**
- Create portfolio of work
- Document key projects
- Collect feedback sources
- Note key accomplishments

**Step 2: Structured self-assessment**
- Ask IC to write self-assessment
- What would they do at next level?
- What are they ready for?
- What do they need to develop?
- Useful even if they're not ready (shows thinking)

**Step 3: Collect peer feedback**
- More important remote
- Wider net of feedback
- Cross-team perspectives
- Specific examples of capability

**Step 4: Manager assessment**
- What have you observed?
- Where are visibility gaps?
- What do you need to see more of?
- Are they ready based on what you know?

**Step 5: Calibration**
- Share read with manager peers
- Compare to other ICs at same level
- Make promotion decision
- Create promotion plan

## Key Takeaways

1. **Visibility requires intentionality** - Async status sharing, artifacts, and visible work
2. **Relationships must be built deliberately** - Regular 1:1s, video, presence
3. **More communication is better** - Don't assume people know what you see
4. **Async can be an advantage** - More time to think, more equity, more inclusion
5. **Timezone matters** - Plan for it, rotate inconvenience
6. **Culture must be explicit** - Growth culture doesn't happen by accident remote
7. **Feedback takes planning** - Schedule it, do it on video, follow up
8. **Peer feedback is critical** - For visibility and fairness

---

**Remember:** Remote work doesn't prevent development or growth—it just requires different practices. When done well, remote can be more equitable and inclusive than in-office development.
