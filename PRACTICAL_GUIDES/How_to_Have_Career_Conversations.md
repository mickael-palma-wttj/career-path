# How to Have Effective Career Conversations

A step-by-step guide to conducting meaningful career development discussions with your ICs.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Career conversations are the foundation of IC development. Done well, they provide clarity, motivation, and direction. Done poorly, they create confusion and disengagement.

**What makes a career conversation effective:**
- Two-way dialogue, not one-way lecture
- IC drives their own development
- Clear understanding of current state and path forward
- Actionable next steps
- Regular follow-up

---

---

**Part 2: Your Assessment (15 minutes)**

**Share your perspective:**
"Here's what I've observed over the past quarter..."

**Structure your feedback:**

**Strengths (2-3 specific examples):**
"You've really excelled at [X]. For example, [specific situation]. This demonstrates [skill at current/next level]."

**Growth Areas (1-2 specific examples):**
"An area for development is [Y]. I noticed [specific situation]. To get to [next level/improve], I'd like to see [specific behavior]."

**Overall assessment:**

## 💬 Example Career Conversations

### Example 1: Junior Developer, First Career Conversation

**Manager:** "I'm excited to work with you! I want to understand where you are in your career and where you want to go. Let's start with: what are your career goals?"

**IC:** "I want to become a Senior Developer eventually."

**Manager:** "That's great! Let's talk about what that path looks like. First, tell me what you think makes someone a Senior Developer?"

**IC:** "Um, I guess being really good at coding and having experience?"

**Manager:** "Those are part of it! Let me show you our career framework. [Pulls up framework]. We have 7 levels: Junior, Confirmed, Senior, Staff, Senior Staff, and Principal. You're currently at Junior level.

Senior is actually 3 levels above you—the progression typically goes Junior → Confirmed → Senior. Most people spend 2-4 years at Confirmed before reaching Senior.

Let me show you what Confirmed looks like vs. Junior... [Walks through framework].

For now, let's focus on what it takes to get to Confirmed level, which is probably 12-24 months away if you develop well. Does that make sense?"

**IC:** "Yes, that's helpful to understand the path."

**Manager:** "Great. What excites you most about software engineering?"

**IC:** "I really like solving problems and learning new technologies."

**Manager:** "Perfect. Over the next quarter, let's focus on building your fundamentals. Here's what I'd like to see:
1. You writing code that needs fewer review iterations
2. You taking on slightly more complex tasks
3. You asking great questions when you're stuck

How does that sound?"

---

### Example 2: Confirmed Developer Asking About Promotion

**IC:** "I've been at Confirmed level for 2 years. When can I expect to get promoted to Senior?"

**Manager:** "I appreciate you asking directly. Let me show you where you are and what Senior level requires. [Pulls up framework].

You're doing well at Confirmed level—your code quality is good, you deliver consistently, and you collaborate well with the team. Those are strengths.

For Senior level, here are the key differences I need to see:

**Technical scope:** Senior engineers lead complex, cross-team projects. Most of your work has been within our team. I need to see you owning projects that require coordinating with other teams.

**Technical leadership:** Senior engineers drive architecture decisions. You participate in design discussions, but I'd like to see you leading them—writing proposals, getting feedback, making the call.

**Mentoring:** Senior engineers actively develop other engineers. You help when asked, but I'd like to see you proactively mentoring someone—owning their growth.

Right now, I'd say you're 12-18 months away from promotion if we focus intentionally on these areas.

Does this feel like a path you want to pursue?"

**IC:** "Yes, definitely. What specifically should I focus on?"

**Manager:** "Let's create a plan. Over the next 6 months:

1. **Lead a cross-team project:** I'll assign you the API redesign that requires working with Mobile and Frontend teams. Own it end-to-end.

2. **Drive a technical decision:** For that project, write the technical spec and lead the architecture discussion. I'll review with you, but you drive it.

3. **Mentor Alex:** Our junior developer Alex could use mentoring. Meet with them biweekly, review their code with coaching feedback, help them with their projects.

We'll check in monthly on progress. If I see consistent Senior-level work in these areas for 6+ months, I'll advocate for your promotion.

Sound good?"

---

### Example 3: Senior Developer Plateauing

**Manager:** "I want to talk about your career. You've been a Senior Developer for 4 years now, and you're doing good work. But I've noticed we haven't talked much about what's next for you. What are you thinking about your career direction?"

**IC:** "Honestly, I'm not sure. I'm comfortable where I am."

**Manager:** "That's totally valid. Not everyone wants to push toward Staff level, and that's perfectly fine. Let me ask: what keeps you engaged in your work?"

**IC:** "I like solving technical problems and working with the team."

**Manager:** "Great. So there are a few paths we could consider:

**Option 1: Deepen Senior excellence.** You become the go-to expert in specific technical domain, known for exceptional quality. You continue at Senior level but become increasingly valuable through deep expertise.

**Option 2: Pursue Staff level.** This is a bigger jump—it means organizational scope, technical strategy, developing leaders. It's more political, more meetings, less hands-on coding. Is that appealing?

**Option 3: Explore management.** Leading a team of engineers. Very different from IC work.

What sounds most interesting to you?"

**IC:** "I think Option 1. I don't really want to be in more meetings or manage people."

**Manager:** "Totally fair! So let's talk about what deep Senior excellence looks like for you. What technical area would you want to own and be known for?

[Continues conversation about becoming domain expert]

This is a completely valid career path. Not everyone needs to reach Staff. Being an exceptional Senior engineer who's an expert in critical areas is incredibly valuable."

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: One-Way Lecture

**What it looks like:**
Manager talks at IC for 45 minutes about what they need to improve.

**Why it fails:**
IC isn't engaged, doesn't buy in, feels lectured.

**Fix:**
Start with their perspective. Ask questions. Make it dialogue. 70/30 rule: they talk 70%, you talk 30%.

---

### Pitfall 2: Vague Feedback

**What it looks like:**
"You need to be more senior."
"Improve your communication."
"Take more ownership."

**Why it fails:**
Not actionable. IC doesn't know what to change.

**Fix:**
Specific examples and specific next steps. "In the API project, I'd like you to write the technical spec and lead the architecture discussion."

---

### Pitfall 3: False Hope

**What it looks like:**
"You're doing great! Keep it up!" (when they're not on promotion track)
"Maybe soon!" (when promotion is 12+ months away)

**Why it fails:**
Creates unrealistic expectations. Leads to resentment later.

**Fix:**
Be honest and specific. "You're solid at your level, but promotion is 12-18 months away. Here's specifically what needs to change."

---

### Pitfall 4: Avoiding Difficult Truth

**What it looks like:**
Not telling someone they're not on promotion track.
Not addressing performance issues.
Being vague to avoid discomfort.

**Why it fails:**
Problems compound. IC is blindsided later. Trust erodes.

**Fix:**
Direct, kind honesty. "I need to be straight with you: you're not on track for promotion right now. Here's why and here's what needs to change."

---

### Pitfall 5: No Follow-Through

**What it looks like:**
Great conversation, create a plan, then never discuss it again.

**Why it fails:**
IC feels abandoned. Development doesn't happen.

**Fix:**
Monthly check-ins. Create the opportunities discussed. Follow up on commitments.
