- **Capability:** Current skills and learning ability exceed role requirements
- **Aspiration:** Desire to move up and take on more responsibility
- **Engagement:** Committed to organization and team
- **Growth trajectory:** Demonstrating clear progress and learning

**NOT the same as:**
- High performer (excels at current level)
- High maintainer (senior expert, not interested in advancement)
- High promotability (ready now, vs. potential)

### Assessment Criteria

**Capability Indicators:**
- Learns new skills quickly
- Demonstrates technical depth for their level
- Understands context and business implications
- Quality of work consistently strong
- Takes on stretch assignments successfully
- Seeks feedback and implements it

**Aspiration Signals:**
- Expresses interest in growth
- Takes on optional challenges
- Asks about next level
- Develops skills for next level
- Mentors others
- Takes leadership in projects

**Engagement Signs:**
- Shows up consistently, doesn't check out
- Cares about team outcomes
- Collaborates effectively
- Stays through transitions
- Invests in relationships
- Open to feedback

**Growth Evidence:**
- Demonstrated progress over 12+ months
- Successfully completed stretch projects
- Received positive feedback progression
- Skills expanding noticeably
- Taking on larger scope
- Making bigger impact

### Identification Process

**Step 1: Start with performance data**
- Current role performance level
- Feedback scores trending up
- Peer and manager assessments
- Promotion readiness past metrics

**Step 2: Have conversations**
- "What are you hoping to do next?"
- "Are you interested in growth?"
- "What challenges interest you?"
- "Where do you want to be in 3 years?"

**Step 3: Manager assessment**
- Is this person capable of next level?
- Do they have bandwidth for development?
- Are they ready now or with development?
- What's their development timeline?

**Step 4: Leadership calibration**
- Team leads discuss high-potentials
- Cross-team perspective
- Identify across org
- Avoid only obvious picks

**Step 5: Create list**
- High-potentials per team
- Target development level
- Timeline (1-2 years typically)
- Current gaps to address

### High-Potential Conversations

**What to discuss:**
```
"I wanted to talk with you about your career growth.
We see real potential in you [specific examples].

I think you could move toward [next level] within 
[timeframe]. Interested in exploring that?

If yes: 'Great—let's create a development plan and 
figure out what support you need.'

If unsure: 'No pressure, but wanted to put it on your 
radar. We'll keep supporting your growth however you 
want it to go.'

If no: 'Got it. Let's still focus on your development 
and making sure you're growing here.'
```

- More frequent check-ins

**Key sections:**
1. **Current state:** What they do well, what they need to develop
2. **Target state:** What they need for next level
3. **Gaps:** Specific areas to develop
4. **Development activities:** How to build those capabilities
5. **Timeline:** Realistic progression steps
6. **Measures of success:** How we'll know they're ready
7. **Support:** Who'll help, what resources needed

## Backfill Planning

### Why It's Critical

When a high-potential moves to new role/level, someone needs to backfill what they leave behind. Poor backfill planning leads to:
- Knowledge gaps
- Workflow disruptions
- Team overwhelmed
- Person leaving stressed about transition
- New role doesn't get proper attention

### Types of Backfill

**1. Internal Promotion**
- Someone from current team moves up
- Another high-potential gets opportunity
- Natural progression
- Challenges: Creates cascading vacancies

**2. Lateral Move**
- Person moves to peer role elsewhere
- Experience moved, expertise available for consultation
- Someone else takes over their original work
- Challenges: Requires coordination across teams

**3. Role Consolidation**
- Work divvied up among existing team members
- No single backfill person
- Assumes role responsibilities fit across others
- Challenges: Risk of overload, gaps in coverage

**4. New Hire**
- Backfill externally
- Good when need fresh perspective or growth
- Challenges: Ramp time, knowledge gaps

**5. Hybrid**
- Combination of above
- Often best approach
- Challenges: Complex to coordinate

### Backfill Planning Timeline

**12 months before transition:**
- Identify person leaving will be promoted/moved
- Start thinking about who backfills
- Begin cross-training candidate
- Document key responsibilities

**6 months before:**
- Decision made on backfill approach
- New person identified or hiring started
- Begin knowledge transfer planning
- Create transition timeline

**3 months before:**
- Knowledge transfer begins
- New person ramping (if internal/hired)
- Original person starting to focus on transition
- Communication to team

**1 month before:**
- Transition underway
- Original person still mostly hands-on
- New person becoming primary
- Critical knowledge still being transferred

**1 month after:**
- New person primary
- Original person available for consultation
- Knowledge transfer continues
- Monitor for gaps

### Documentation for Backfill

Create handoff package:
- **Role responsibilities:** What does this person do day-to-day?
- **Key projects:** What's in flight?
- **Relationships:** Who do they work with regularly?
- **Systems/tools:** What systems do they need to know?
- **Decisions:** How are typical decisions made?
- **Escalations:** When and how to escalate?
- **Annual events:** What happens when in the year?
- **Known issues:** What problems are ongoing?

---

## Knowledge Transfer

### Types of Knowledge

**Explicit knowledge:**
- How systems work
- Processes and procedures
- Technical architecture
- Tools and technologies
- Documentation
- **Easier to transfer**

**Implicit knowledge:**
- Judgment calls and tradeoffs
- Relationship nuance
- Historical context
- "Why" behind decisions
- Expert patterns
- **Harder to transfer**

### Knowledge Transfer Activities

**Documentation:**
- Write guides and runbooks
- Create decision frameworks
- Document architecture
- Codify processes
- Video walkthroughs
- Effective for explicit knowledge

**Pair work:**
- Work on projects together
- Original person leads, new person observes
- Gradually shift responsibility
- Best for implicit knowledge

**Mentorship:**
- Regular meetings to discuss decisions
- Asking original person for advice
- Retrospectives together
- Ongoing (not just during transition)

**Meetings with stakeholders:**
- Introduce new person to key partners
- Original person explains relationships
- New person learns context
- Stakeholders meet new contact

**Projects with handoff:**
- Tackle project together
- Original person leads initially
- Gradually new person takes over
- Complete with new person leading

### Knowledge Transfer Timeline

**Week 1-2: Orientation**
- Team introduction
- System access and tools
- Documentation review
- Meet key stakeholders

**Week 3-6: Deep dives**
- Pair on real work
- Learn about systems
- Understand key decisions
- Build relationships

**Week 7-12: Gradual Takeover**
- New person leads with support
- Original person mostly observes
- Handle first incident/problem
- Make first independent decision

**Week 13+: Independence**
- New person primary owner
- Original person available for consultation
- Identify any remaining gaps
- Plan ongoing learning

- Visible progress
- Regular feedback
- Celebrate milestones
- Keep compensation competitive

**After promotion:**
- Welcome to new level
- Not expected to be expert immediately
- Mentorship continues
- New peer group support
- Recognition in new role
- Stay engaged with previous team

**Ongoing:**
- Annual compensation review
- New growth opportunities
- Leadership development
- Board or committee roles
- External visibility opportunities
- Culture of continuous growth

### Recognizing Flight Risk

**Warning signs:**
- Starts job searching (usually shows in email)
- Reduced engagement in meetings
- Avoids planning for future
- Complains about resources/support
- Less collaboration with team

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Lack of High-Potential Development Depth

**Problem:** Not enough high-potentials being developed, creating talent gaps at higher levels

**Root causes:**
- Not identifying high-potentials early enough
- Development plans not clear or active
- Stretch opportunities not available
- People leave for external opportunities
- Promotion barriers blocking advancement

**Solutions:**
- Systematize identification process
- Create clear development plans
- Increase stretch project opportunities
- Make growth visible and celebrated
- Lower barriers where possible
- Mentor/sponsor relationships

### Challenge 2: High-Potential Development Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Takes 3+ years to get someone ready, but they get impatient or external offers come

**Root causes:**
- Waiting for perfect readiness
- Not enough development opportunities
- Unclear timeline creating frustration
- External opportunities seem faster

**Solutions:**
- Accelerate development (when safe)
- Create more stretch opportunities
- Provide sponsor to advocate
- Be realistic about timeline
- Create interim "in-between" roles
- Celebrate progress

### Challenge 3: Backfill Person Isn't Ready

**Problem:** Promote someone, backfill person struggles, person promoted also struggling in new role

**Root causes:**
- Backfill person picked wrong
- Not enough prep for backfill
- Original person not available
- Role too big for new person
- Wrong skills for role

**Solutions:**
- Right-size backfill responsibility
- More support for backfill person
- Original person available longer
- Consider different backfill approach
- May need to move people around

### Challenge 4: Can't Retain Developed High-Potentials

**Problem:** Develop someone, then they leave for external opportunity

**Root causes:**
- Competition finding them
- External opportunity better than what's available
- Want change of scenery
- Compensation misaligned
- Opportunity elsewhere came first

**Solutions:**
- Stay competitive on comp/benefits
- Regular conversations about what they want
- Create opportunities internally
- Build strong manager relationships
- Sometimes you have to let people go
- Use departures as learning

### Challenge 5: Succession Planning Only for Top Roles

**Problem:** Focus on successor to VP, miss continuity needs for critical individual contributors

**Root causes:**
- Focus on leadership levels
- Underestimate IC role importance
- Easier to replace ICs externally
- Resource limitations

**Solutions:**
- Map critical roles at all levels
- Plan succession for key ICs too
- Identify expertise gaps
- Create knowledge distribution
- Value critical ICs appropriately
