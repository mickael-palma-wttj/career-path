## Why Peer Feedback Matters

### What is Peer Feedback?

**Peer feedback** is structured input from colleagues about an IC's performance, collaboration, impact, and growth areas. It's distinct from manager feedback because:

- **360-degree perspective** - Views from multiple angles and relationships
- **Behavioral evidence** - Concrete examples of how someone works with others
- **Blind spots revealed** - Gaps between self-perception and peer perception
- **Collaboration assessment** - How someone works with peers, not just reports
- **Team dynamics impact** - Effects on team morale, productivity, trust

### Why Collect It?

**For the IC:**
- Self-awareness building
- Identifying blind spots
- Understanding team perception
- Evidence for promotion cases
- Development goal clarity
- Confidence in feedback authenticity

**For the Manager:**
- Multiple perspectives on performance
- Validate personal observations
- Identify collaboration issues
- Assess team impact
- Evidence for performance decisions
- Spot high-potential ICs

**For the Team:**
- Psychological safety (everyone gives/receives feedback)
- Clear expectations for collaboration
- Normalize feedback culture
- Reduce surprises in evaluations
- Build trust through transparency

**For the Organization:**
- Stronger feedback culture
- Better promotion decisions
- Earlier identification of problems
- Development of better team players
- Improved retention

## Understanding 360 Feedback

### The Traditional 360 Model

**Feedback sources** (the "360"):
- **Upward:** From direct reports (if IC has leadership role)
- **Lateral:** From peers and cross-team colleagues
- **Downward:** From manager
- **Self:** IC's own assessment
- **Optional:** Customers, partners, or other stakeholders

### Why This Matters

**Balanced perspective:**
- Manager sees performance in 1:1s and formal settings
- Peers see collaboration in daily work
- Reports see leadership approach (if applicable)
- IC sees internal motivations and challenges
- Together = comprehensive picture

**Reduces bias:**
- Multiple observers reduce individual bias
- Different relationships reveal different facets
- Triangulation increases accuracy
- Harder for single negative opinion to dominate

## When to Collect Peer Feedback

### Ideal Timing

**Annual/Bi-Annual:**
- Part of annual review cycle
- Regular development planning
- Standard practice for all ICs
- Creates consistent feedback culture

**Promotion Assessment:**
- 2-3 months before promotion consideration
- Demonstrates collaboration at next level
- Shows peer perception of readiness
- Provides evidence for promotion packet

**Project Completion:**
- After significant cross-team projects
- Captures fresh feedback about collaboration
- Demonstrates impact beyond immediate team
- Provides examples for portfolio building

**Specific Development Goals:**
- When IC is working on collaboration skills
- After conflict resolution
- When expanding leadership responsibilities
- To show progress on specific areas

**When Concerns Arise:**
- Collaboration issues with peers
- Behavioral concerns
- Team dynamics problems
- Before escalation needed

### Timing to Avoid

**During High Stress:**
- During major crisis or outage
- Right after difficult projects
- When team is overwhelmed
- During reorganizations

**Too Frequently:**
- More than 2x per year for routine feedback
- Can feel like constant evaluation
- Creates survey fatigue
- Reduces thoughtful responses

**Right After Conflict:**
- Wait 2-4 weeks after resolving issues
- Allows emotions to settle
- Feedback more objective
- Demonstrates learning from situation

## Preparing for Feedback Collection

### Step 1: Set Clear Purpose

**Define why you're collecting feedback:**
- "We're doing 360s to inform annual performance review"
- "We're assessing readiness for promotion"
- "We're supporting development in collaboration skills"
- "We're building feedback culture across team"

**Communicate this purpose:**
- To the IC: Why they're getting feedback, what you'll do with it
- To feedback providers: Context for their input
- To leadership: How results will be used

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach

**Formal 360 Tools:**
- Online platforms (Culture Amp, Lattice, 15Five, etc.)
- Standardized questions
- Anonymous responses
- Automated reporting
- Best for: Larger organizations, multiple cycles, consistency needed

**Semi-Formal Process:**
- Manager conducts interviews or email survey
- Standardized but flexible questions
- Semi-anonymous (manager knows who said what, IC doesn't)
- Manual synthesis
- Best for: Smaller teams, ongoing feedback, relationship-building

**Informal Conversations:**
- Manager talks with peers
- Natural language
- Full anonymity usually
- Personal synthesis
- Best for: Urgent feedback needs, specific concerns, small teams

### Step 3: Prepare the IC

**What to tell them:**
- "We're collecting feedback from your peers to support your development"
- "You'll get a summary of themes, not individual quotes"
- "This won't be used punitively unless serious issues emerge"
- "You'll have a chance to discuss findings with me"
- "We're all doing this—it's how we build culture"

**What to ask them:**
- "Who do you think sees your work most clearly?"
- "What feedback are you hoping to get?"
- "What concerns do you have about the process?"
- "Are there people you know wouldn't give honest feedback?"

**Set expectations:**
- "You might hear things that are surprising or uncomfortable—that's often where growth happens"
- "Feedback is a gift, even when it's hard to receive"
- "We'll talk about what to do with this feedback"

### Step 4: Build Trust

**Key principles:**
- **Confidentiality:** Protect feedback provider anonymity
- **Transparency:** Clear about process and how feedback will be used
- **Safety:** Feedback won't be used punitively without context
- **Reciprocity:** Everyone gives and receives feedback
- **Growth focus:** Feedback is for development, not just judgment

## Selecting Feedback Providers

### Who Should Give Feedback?

**The peer feedback sweet spot:**
- People who see the IC regularly in work
- People who collaborate with them directly
- People at similar or slightly different levels
- People from different perspectives (if possible)
- People who care about giving honest feedback

### Number of Providers

**Typical range:**
- **Minimum:** 4-5 people (enough for themes, anonymity)
- **Ideal:** 6-8 people (balance quality and burden)
- **Maximum:** 10-12 people (diminishing returns, more noise)

**Fewer if:**
- Smaller team
- Specific issue feedback
- First time doing 360s
- Short feedback window

**More if:**
- Large organization
- Cross-functional role
- Promotion decision
- Full organization feedback culture

### How to Select

**Best practice:**
1. **Manager suggests:** "I'm thinking these people would see your work well..."
2. **IC confirms:** "Yes, add Sarah. Actually, remove Tom—we don't work together much"
3. **Manager adjusts:** Balances IC comfort with diversity of perspective
4. **Final list:** 6-8 people across different teams/perspectives

**Diversity of providers:**
- Different teams or functions
- Mix of direct collaborators and extended network
- People IC works with frequently and occasionally
- Different perspectives (technical, product, operations, etc.)

### Who Should NOT Give Feedback

**Avoid:**
- Direct reports (if IC has any)
- People in active conflict with IC (wait until resolved)
- People who rarely see IC's work (won't have basis)
- People IC has asked to give feedback (loses anonymity)
- Romantic partners or very close friends (too biased)

## Designing the Feedback Questions

### Question Categories

**Collaboration & Teamwork:**
- How effectively does [IC] work with others?
- Does [IC] share knowledge and help others?
- How do you experience [IC]'s collaboration style?
- Does [IC] consider others' perspectives?

**Communication:**
- Is [IC]'s communication clear?
- Does [IC] listen well?
- How well does [IC] explain technical concepts?
- Does [IC] adapt communication style to audience?

**Technical Contribution:**
- What's your assessment of [IC]'s technical work?
- Does [IC]'s work meet quality standards?
- How much do you learn from working with [IC]?
- What's [IC]'s area of strongest technical contribution?

**Leadership/Influence:**
- Does [IC] take on leadership responsibilities?

- Pros: Specific, authentic, reveals thinking
- Cons: Longer to respond, harder to synthesize

**Likert scale (for patterns):**
- "[IC] collaborates effectively" - Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree
- Pros: Easy to quantify, compare across people
- Cons: Less nuanced, may not capture full picture

**Mix (best approach):**
- 2-3 Likert scales on key behaviors
- 3-5 open-ended questions
- Keeps it reasonable length
- Gets both patterns and richness

### Sample Question Set

**For general 360:**
1. How would you describe working with [IC]?
2. Likert: [IC] is easy to collaborate with (1-5)
3. What's one area where [IC] excels?
4. What's one area where [IC] could develop?
5. Likert: [IC] contributes at their current level (1-5)
6. Is there anything else you'd like to share?

**For promotion assessment:**
1. Likert: Ready for next level (1-5)
2. What would make [IC] more effective at next level?
3. How does [IC] compare to others at similar level?
4. Likert: Would be strong IC at next level (1-5)

## Conducting the Feedback Process

### Communication to Providers

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Your Input Needed: Feedback for [IC Name]

Hi [Provider],

We're collecting 360-degree feedback to support [IC]'s development 
(or promotion assessment). Your perspective would be valuable because 
[specific reason—you work together on X, you see their impact on Y, etc.].

Would you be willing to provide feedback? It should take 10-15 minutes 
and your responses will be confidential.

[Link to survey or instructions]

Deadline: [Date - give 1 week minimum]

Thanks!
```

**In-person pitch:**
- "We're doing 360s for [IC], would you be willing to give feedback?"
- "It's about 15 minutes of your time"
- "Your responses will be confidential"
- "It really helps their development"
- "Here's the link..."

### Managing the Process

**Before deadline:**
- Day 1-2: Send invitation
- Day 3-4: One reminder to non-responders
- Day 5-6: Final reminder if needed
- Plan synthesis work after deadline

**Response rate targets:**
- Aim for 80-100% if possible
- Follow up on low responders
- If someone won't respond, that data too (may indicate relationship issue)

**Maintaining confidentiality:**
- Use tool's anonymization features
- Don't mention who responded
- Aggregate feedback (3+ people minimum per theme)
- Don't quote single response unless pattern across multiple

---

## Synthesizing Feedback

### Organizing the Data

**Create a synthesis document:**
```
FEEDBACK SYNTHESIS FOR [IC NAME]
Date: [Date]
Feedback providers: 7 peers

STRENGTHS (What appeared across multiple feedbacks)
- Technical depth/expertise (5 mentions)
- Helpful and mentoring (6 mentions)
- Clear communicator (4 mentions)

AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT
- Could improve on X (4 mentions)
- Sometimes Y (3 mentions)
- Occasional concern about Z (2 mentions)

PATTERNS & THEMES
- Feedback on collaboration was consistently positive
- Some variation on X (some see as strength, some as challenge)
- No major concerns raised

QUESTIONS FOR IC TO DISCUSS
- Why do you think peers mentioned X?
- How do you explain the feedback on Y?
```

### Synthesizing Process

**Step 1: Read all responses**
- Look for patterns
- Note recurring themes
- Identify outliers
- Spot contradictions

**Step 2: Categorize**
- Group by topic (collaboration, communication, etc.)
- Count frequency of mentions
- Note strength of sentiment
- Identify nuance and caveats

**Step 3: Identify themes**
- What's the strongest pattern?
- Where's there disagreement?
- What surprised you?
- What confirms your observations?
- What's missing?

**Step 4: Draft summary**
- Lead with strengths
- Share growth areas with context
- Include specific examples (without attribution)
- Highlight surprising findings
- Note areas of disagreement

### Handling Difficult Feedback

**Negative pattern:** Multiple people mention same concern
- Include it, but with nuance
- "Several peers mentioned [X]... it might be worth exploring"
- Provide context if you have it
- Focus on "what to do about it" not just the problem

**Outlier negative:** One person very critical
- Usually don't surface single critical comment
- Exception: If it's serious issue (ethical, safety, harassment)
- Can mention without attribution: "One person raised a concern about [X]..."
- Discuss with IC privately what it might be

**Contradiction:** Some say it's strength, some say weakness
- Surface both perspectives
- "Peers have varying views on [X]—some see it as strength, others as development area"
- Help IC understand why (context-dependent strength/weakness)
- Opportunity for IC to be more flexible

**No clear data:** Feedback spread across many topics
- Synthesis harder, not necessarily bad
- May indicate IC is different things to different people
- Could be strength (adaptable) or challenge (inconsistent)
- Ask IC for their perspective

---

## Sharing Results with the IC

### Preparation

**Before the meeting:**
- Schedule 1 hour focused time
- Choose private setting
- Have synthesis document ready but not sent yet
- Prepare to listen more than talk
- Plan next steps (coaching, goals, etc.)

**Set IC's expectations:**
- "We've collected feedback. I'll walk you through themes, not individual quotes"
- "This is for your development, not to punish"
- "You might hear things that surprise or sting—that's normal"
- "Let's talk about what to do with it"

### The Feedback Conversation

**Structure:**

**Opening (5 min):**
- "Thanks for being open to this feedback"
- "Feedback is a gift, even when it's hard"
- "I'll share themes, not individual quotes"
- "I want your reaction—let's discuss"

**Strengths first (10 min):**
- "Here's where peers see you excelling..."
- Share specific examples
- Let IC respond: "How does that land? Surprised? Expected?"
- Reinforce these strengths

**Development areas (15 min):**
- "Here are areas multiple peers mentioned for growth..."
- One area at a time
- Share examples (anonymized)
- Pause for IC reaction
- "How does that land? Do you see it? Where did it come from?"

**Discussion (15 min):**
- "What surprised you?"
- "What confirmed what you already knew?"
- "Where do you disagree?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- Listen more than talk

**Next steps (15 min):**
- "So what do we do with this?"
- Help IC identify 1-2 focus areas
- Connect to existing development goals
- Plan actions/support
- Schedule follow-up

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Lead with strengths
- Use "feedback indicates" not "people think"
- Provide specific examples
- Allow IC to process and react
- Discuss what surprised you
- Help IC see patterns
- Focus on development

**Don't:**
- Attribute quotes to individuals
- Spring surprising feedback without prep
- Debate whether feedback is "right"
- Make it personal or take it personally
- Use feedback punitively
- Dismiss IC's concerns
- Over-focus on one negative theme

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Low Response Rate

**Problem:** Only 2-3 people responded

**Solutions:**
- **Follow up:** Personal asks often work better than email reminders
- **Extend deadline:** Give more time if busy season
- **Adjust participants:** Maybe those selected are too busy, ask others
- **Simplify:** Make survey shorter, fewer questions
- **Next time:** Pick people who are better positioned to respond

### Challenge 2: Feedback is Too Positive

**Problem:** Everyone gave glowing feedback, no growth areas mentioned

**Possible causes:**
- IC is genuinely strong
- Peers uncomfortable giving critical feedback
- Low trust in confidentiality
- Safe choices rather than honest feedback
- Selection bias (only friendly peers selected)

**Solutions:**
- **Check with IC:** "Do you feel this captures the real picture?"
- **Look for patterns in what's NOT said:** Silence on some topics is data
- **Reframe for development:** "Everyone's strong somewhere—what's one area to develop?"
- **Next time:** Build more trust, emphasize development focus
- **Manager adds perspective:** "I see some areas I think you could grow..."

### Challenge 3: Feedback is Too Harsh

**Problem:** Feedback seems disproportionately negative

**Possible causes:**
- One negative person skewing results
- Team conflict or resentment
- IC actually has real issues
- Peers feel unsafe enough to be honest
- Selection bias toward critical people

**Solutions:**
- **Evaluate patterns:** Is this consensus or one person?
- **Look for context:** Are there team dynamics at play?
- **Triangulate:** Does manager see same issues?
- **Talk to IC first:** Get their perspective before assuming
- **Consider timing:** Address team dynamics if present
- **Follow up:** More frequent 1:1s, coaching on concerns

### Challenge 4: IC Gets Defensive

**Problem:** IC dismisses feedback, blames others, or shuts down

**In the moment:**
- Stay calm, don't match defensiveness
- "I hear you're frustrated by this feedback"
- "Let's sit with it for a bit before deciding how to respond"
- "This doesn't mean you're doing everything wrong"
- "What's one piece you'd be willing to consider?"

**After conversation:**
- Give IC time to process
- Follow up in next 1:1: "Thinking more about that feedback...?"
- Help IC find one actionable piece
- Coach on receiving feedback
- Consider if this itself is feedback theme

### Challenge 5: Contradiction in Feedback

**Problem:** IC got opposite feedback from different people

**This is normal and useful:**
- May indicate situational strength/weakness
- May indicate IC behaves differently with different people
- May indicate IC needs more consistency
- May indicate feedback provider differences in values

**How to handle:**
- "Peers have different perspectives on [X]"
- Explore: "Why might some see X and others see Y?"
- Help IC understand context
- "Which perspective feels most true?"
- "What would help you be more consistent?"

### Challenge 6: Feedback on Behavior You Haven't Observed

**Problem:** Peers say IC does [X], but you've never seen it

**Possible explanations:**
- IC behaves differently with peers than manager
- You haven't seen enough interactions
- You're not aware of all IC's work
- Feedback is inaccurate
- Peers misinterpreted something

**What to do:**
- Don't dismiss: "I haven't seen that, but that doesn't mean it's not happening"
- "Help me understand when this happens"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- Observe more carefully going forward
- Keep open mind—peer perception is valid data

## Key Takeaways

1. **Peer feedback provides perspective** that manager feedback alone cannot
2. **Anonymity is critical** to honest feedback
3. **Frame as development** not judgment to build trust
4. **Synthesis matters** - how you present feedback shapes impact
5. **Receiving matters** - how IC processes feedback determines value
6. **Patterns matter** - single comments less important than themes
7. **Follow-up matters** - feedback only valuable if acted upon
8. **Consistency matters** - regular feedback builds culture

---

**Remember:** 360 feedback works best when it's part of a culture where everyone gives and receives feedback regularly. Build that culture one cycle at a time.
