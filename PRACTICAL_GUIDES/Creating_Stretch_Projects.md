## What is a Stretch Project?

A **stretch project** is a work assignment that pushes an IC beyond their current comfort zone to develop new skills, gain broader experience, or demonstrate capabilities at the next level.

### Key Characteristics

**Challenging but Achievable:**
- Requires learning new skills or applying existing skills in new ways
- Should be approximately 10-20% beyond current capability
- Success is possible with effort and support

**Growth-Oriented:**
- Directly tied to development goals
- Fills specific gaps in current skill set
- Provides evidence for promotion readiness

**Real Impact:**
- Contributes actual business value
- Not a "practice" or "training" project
- Has meaningful stakes and stakeholders

**Time-Bound:**
- Clear beginning and end
- Typically 1-3 months for smaller stretches
- 3-6 months for larger initiatives

**Visible:**
- Results can be observed and evaluated
- Provides concrete examples for promotion cases
- Demonstrates growth to broader team/organization

## What Makes a Good Stretch Project

### The STRETCH Framework

**S - Specific to Development Goals**
- Directly addresses gaps identified in development plan
- Aligned with IC's career aspirations
- Contributes to promotion readiness

**T - Time-Boxed**
- Clear start and end dates
- Manageable scope (not endless)
- Fits within quarterly or half-year planning

**R - Real Business Value**
- Solves actual problem or need
- Has stakeholders who care about outcome
- Success matters to the organization

**E - Evidence-Generating**
- Creates visible, demonstrable output
- Can be included in promotion packet
- Provides concrete examples of capability

**T - Teaching Opportunity**
- Involves learning new skills or approaches
- Includes mentorship or guidance
- Builds on existing foundation

**C - Calculated Risk**
- Challenging but not impossible
- Failure won't be catastrophic
- Safety net exists if needed

**H - High Visibility**
- Results will be seen by others
- Opportunity to present or share learnings
- Builds reputation beyond immediate team

### The Goldilocks Principle

**Too Small (Not a Stretch):**
- Can do it easily with current skills
- No real learning required
- Doesn't demonstrate new capabilities
- **Example:** Senior developer writing another CRUD endpoint

**Just Right:**
- Requires learning and growth
- Success is possible but not guaranteed
- Pushes boundaries in 1-2 key areas
- **Example:** Senior developer leading architecture design for new service

**Too Big (Overwhelming):**
- Multiple significant skill gaps
- Success unlikely without major support
- May damage confidence if failed
- **Example:** Senior developer solo building entire platform with unfamiliar tech stack

## Identifying the Right Stretch Project

### Assessment Process

**Step 1: Review Development Goals**
- What skills need development?
- What gaps exist for next level?
- What interests has IC expressed?

**Step 2: Scan for Opportunities**
- Upcoming projects on roadmap
- Existing problems or pain points
- Cross-team collaboration needs
- Technical debt or improvement areas
- Process or culture initiatives

**Step 3: Match Opportunity to IC**
- Does it address specific development goal?
- Is it the right size stretch?
- Does IC have foundational skills needed?
- Is timing appropriate?

**Step 4: Validate Feasibility**
- Is there executive support?
- Are resources available?
- Is timeline realistic?
- What happens if it fails?

**Step 5: Confirm with IC**
- Is IC interested and motivated?
- Do they understand the stretch?
- Are they willing to accept the challenge?
- Do they agree on support needed?

### Questions to Ask

**For the IC:**
- "What would you like to get better at?"
- "What kind of work energizes you?"
- "What scares you a little but excites you?"
- "If you could work on anything next quarter, what would it be?"

**For the Opportunity:**
- "What skills does this require?"
- "Who would benefit if this succeeds?"
- "What support would be needed?"
- "What's the worst that could happen?"

**For the Match:**
- "Does this align with your career goals?"
- "Do you feel ready to take this on?"
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "What would success look like?"

## Risk Management

### Assessing Risk Level

**Low Risk:**
- IC has 70-80% of skills needed
- Failure won't impact critical systems
- Clear escalation path exists
- Timeline has buffer
- **Action:** Provide light mentorship and check-ins

**Medium Risk:**
- IC has 50-70% of skills needed
- Failure would be inconvenient but manageable
- Support available but not guaranteed
- Timeline is realistic but tight
- **Action:** Regular check-ins, paired programming, active mentorship

**High Risk:**
- IC has <50% of skills needed
- Failure would have significant impact
- Support may be limited
- Timeline is aggressive
- **Action:** Consider if this is right stretch, provide extensive support, or choose different project

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Before Starting**

**Pair with Experienced IC:**
- Shadow someone who's done similar work
- Get advice on approach
- Review designs together

**Spike/Prototype First:**
- Small proof-of-concept before full project
- Test riskiest assumptions early
- Validate approach before commitment

**Clear Success Criteria:**
- Define what "good enough" looks like
- Identify must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- Set checkpoints for go/no-go decisions

**Support Network:**
- Identify subject matter experts to consult
- Schedule regular reviews with senior ICs
- Plan manager check-ins

**During Execution**

**Regular Check-ins:**
- Weekly 1:1 discussion on progress
- Bi-weekly demos to stakeholders
- Monthly retrospective on learnings

**Early Warning System:**
- Red/yellow/green status updates
- Clear escalation triggers
- Open communication about struggles

**Scope Management:**
- Be willing to cut scope if needed
- Focus on learning over perfection
- Celebrate progress, not just completion

**After Completion**

**Reflect on Learnings:**
- What went well?
- What was harder than expected?
- What would you do differently?
- What did you learn?

**Document Outcomes:**
- Create artifacts for promotion packet
- Share learnings with team
- Update development plan

**Adjust Future Stretches:**
- Was this the right size stretch?
- What should next stretch focus on?
- How can we apply learnings?

### When to Pull Back

**Warning Signs:**
- IC is overwhelmed and stressed (not challenged)
- Minimal progress after 3-4 weeks
- Stakeholders losing confidence
- IC wants to quit project
- Critical business need not being met

**How to Pull Back Gracefully:**
1. **Private conversation** - Discuss observations without judgment
2. **Reframe as learning** - "We learned this is bigger than expected"
3. **Provide support** - Bring in additional resources or change scope
4. **Preserve confidence** - "This doesn't mean you can't do it, but timing/support wasn't right"
5. **Plan next step** - Find smaller stretch or revisit when better positioned

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stretch projects are critical for IC growth** - They provide the practical experience and evidence needed for promotion.

2. **The right stretch is just beyond reach** - It should require growth but be achievable with support.

3. **Real business value is non-negotiable** - Practice projects don't provide the same learning or evidence.

4. **Support structure determines success** - Mentorship, time, and resources are essential.

5. **Failure is part of the process** - Focus on learning and psychological safety.

6. **Different stretches for different levels** - What stretches a junior won't stretch a senior.

7. **Measure learning, not just delivery** - Growth is the primary goal, results are secondary.

8. **Documentation creates promotion evidence** - Capture achievements for future use.

---

**Remember:** The goal of a stretch project isn't perfection—it's growth. Create an environment where ICs feel safe to try, fail, learn, and ultimately succeed at the next level.
