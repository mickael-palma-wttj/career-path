# Practical Guides

Step-by-step guides for common manager tasks and challenges. These go deeper than templates, providing frameworks, language, and decision-making guidance.

## 📚 All Guides

### 1️⃣ How_to_Have_Career_Conversations.md
**Purpose:** Complete guide to conducting effective career development discussions

**When to use:** Regularly throughout the year—quarterly check-ins, promotion discussions, performance conversations, initial career talks

**What's covered:**
- **4 types of career conversations** (Initial, Quarterly Check-in, Promotion, Performance Issue)
- **Step-by-step guide** for each conversation type
- **Before the meeting preparation** (review performance, assess framework, gather feedback)
- **During the meeting** (opening, dialogue, decision-making)
- **After the meeting** (documentation, follow-up actions)
- **Dialogue examples** with actual language to use
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Making it two-way** so IC drives their own development
- **Handling difficult moments** (they don't like your feedback, disagree with assessment)

**Why it matters:** Career conversations are the foundation of development. Done well, they motivate and clarify. Done poorly, they create confusion and disengagement.

### 2️⃣ How_to_Address_Underperformance.md
**Purpose:** Framework for managing underperformance with clarity and compassion

**When to use:** When IC is struggling and coaching hasn't worked, need to escalate or put someone on formal improvement plan

**What's covered:**
- **Recognizing underperformance** (gap between expected and actual)
- **Diagnostic questions** (is this skill gap, motivation, fit, or something else?)
- **Having the conversation** (step-by-step)
- **Documentation** (what to write down and keep)
- **Creating improvement plan** (specific goals, timeline, support)
- **Check-in cadence** (how often to follow up)
- **Possible outcomes** (improvement, transition to different role, or departure)
- **Legal/HR considerations** (when to involve HR)
- **Supporting the person** (even while holding them accountable)
- **When to escalate** (recognizing when it's time to move toward termination)

**Why it matters:** Underperformance affects team, and avoiding the conversation hurts everyone. Clear, compassionate confrontation is most kind.

### 3️⃣ Creating_Stretch_Projects.md
**Purpose:** How to identify, design, and assign stretch projects that develop ICs

**When to use:** When IC is ready for next level or needs specific skill development

**What's covered:**
- **Why stretch projects matter** (only way to develop higher-level skills)
- **Identifying stretch opportunities** (what's the gap between current and next level?)
- **Designing the project** (scope, support, timeline, success criteria)
- **Assigning it** (making it clear it's a stretch, not criticism)
- **Supporting along the way** (mentoring, feedback, course correction)
- **What successful stretch looks like** (challenging but achievable, high learning)
- **What failed stretch looks like** (too hard, under-supported, or not challenging enough)
- **Debrief and learning** (after project, what did they learn?)
- **Examples** by level (what does Staff-level stretch vs. Senior-level stretch look like?)

**Why it matters:** Career growth happens through progressively larger challenges. Stretch projects are how ICs develop next-level skills.

### 4️⃣ Peer_Feedback_Collection.md
**Purpose:** How to systematically collect and use peer feedback

**When to use:** Before promotions, mid-year reviews, when IC needs specific feedback, during 360 reviews

**What's covered:**
- **Why peer feedback matters** (360 perspective, impact on team, blind spots)
- **Who to ask** (choosing right peers and stakeholders)
- **What to ask** (questions that get useful feedback, not generic praise)
- **Timing** (when to send feedback requests)
- **Creating psychological safety** (making it safe for people to be honest)
- **Synthesis** (how to read feedback and find patterns)
- **Presenting it** (sharing with IC in constructive way)
- **Using it** (linking feedback to development plan)
- **Following up** (checking on improvement over time)
- **Avoiding bias** (ensuring feedback is about behavior, not personality)

**Why it matters:** Managers see only part of the picture. Peer feedback reveals blind spots and provides broader perspective.

### 5️⃣ Remote_Team_Development.md
**Purpose:** Adapting career development practices for remote teams

**When to use:** When managing remote or distributed teams

**What's covered:**
- **Challenges of remote development** (less informal learning, harder to observe work, relationship building)
- **1:1 meetings** (remote 1:1 cadence, creating psychological safety over video)
- **Career conversations** (doing them effectively remotely)
- **Feedback** (real-time feedback, peer feedback collection)
- **Visibility** (helping remote ICs be visible to broader org)
- **Stretch projects** (assigning and supporting remotely)
- **Mentoring** (pairing people across distances)
- **Culture** (building connections and team identity remotely)
- **Tools** (technology that helps remote development)
- **Common pitfalls** (what goes wrong with remote development and how to avoid)

**Why it matters:** Remote development requires intentional practices. Without them, development suffers and retention becomes harder.

### 6️⃣ Succession_Planning.md
**Purpose:** How to identify and develop future leaders and managers

**When to use:** Quarterly/annual planning, when preparing for departures, building leadership bench strength

**What's covered:**
- **Why succession planning matters** (reduces risk, provides development opportunity, builds culture)
- **Identifying high potential** (who has next-level potential?)
- **Creating development plans** (targeted development for future leaders)
- **Pairing with mentors** (exposing them to higher-level work)
- **Stretch assignments** (bigger responsibilities to prepare them)
- **Visibility** (making sure leadership sees them)
- **Retention** (keeping high potentials engaged)
- **Communication** (being transparent about succession plans)
- **Pipeline health** (monitoring: do we have enough ready-now and ready-soon leaders?)
- **Cross-functional moves** (rotating people to build breadth)
- **Executive coaching** (investing in top talent)

**Why it matters:** Succession planning ensures continuity, provides career paths for high performers, and reduces surprise departures.
