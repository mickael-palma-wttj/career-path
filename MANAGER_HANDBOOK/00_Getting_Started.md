# Getting Started: Manager's Guide to IC Career Development

Welcome! This guide will help you quickly understand the IC Career Development Framework and start using it effectively with your team.

---

## 🎯 Your Role as a Manager

As an engineering manager, you are:

✅ **The Career Coach** - Helping ICs understand their growth path  
✅ **The Opportunity Creator** - Finding stretch projects and learning experiences  
✅ **The Feedback Provider** - Giving regular, specific, actionable input  
✅ **The Advocate** - Championing your ICs for promotion and recognition  
✅ **The Blocker Remover** - Clearing obstacles to their development  

**But you are NOT solely responsible for their career growth.** Career development is a partnership between you and each IC.

## 🧭 Core Principles to Guide You

### 1. **Transparency Builds Trust**
Share this framework openly with your ICs. Let them see:
- What's expected at their level
- What's required for promotion
- Where they currently stand
- What specific areas to develop

**Why:** When people understand the game, they can play it better.

### 2. **Feedback Should Be Continuous, Not Annual**
Don't save feedback for reviews. Give it:
- **In the moment** - When you observe something
- **Specifically** - Tied to concrete behaviors
- **Bidirectionally** - Ask for feedback on your management too

**Why:** Real-time feedback creates faster learning loops.

### 3. **Evidence Over Opinions**
Base your assessments on:
- Observed behaviors and outcomes
- Peer feedback and collaboration patterns
- Artifacts (code, docs, presentations)
- Impact on projects and team

**Why:** Concrete evidence makes feedback actionable and reduces bias.

### 4. **Different Paths, Same Standards**
Some ICs will:
- Progress quickly through early levels
- Plateau at a level that matches their aspirations
- Move laterally to explore different strengths
- Take breaks in growth for personal reasons

**All of this is okay.** The standards remain consistent, but the journey is individual.

### 5. **Promotion Shouldn't Surprise Anyone**
If you're doing this right:
- ICs working toward promotion know it 6+ months in advance
- You've clearly articulated what "ready" looks like
- They've demonstrated readiness consistently
- The promotion decision validates what everyone already knows

**Why:** Surprises (positive or negative) mean communication failed.

## 💬 Your First Career Conversation

### Opening
> "I'd like to spend time today talking about your career goals and how I can support you. I want to make sure we're aligned on where you want to go and what you need to get there. This framework is a tool to help us both be clear about expectations and progress."

### Key Questions to Ask

**Understanding Aspirations:**
- "Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?"
- "What kind of work energizes you? What drains you?"
- "Are you interested in people management, or do you prefer the IC track?"
- "What does success look like for you in your career?"

**Current State Assessment:**
- "Looking at [their level], which areas do you feel strongest in?"
- "Which areas would you like to develop further?"
- "What projects or experiences have been most valuable for your growth?"
- "What obstacles are getting in the way of your development?"

**Creating Alignment:**
- "Based on your goals, here's what I'm seeing as priorities..."
- "Does that align with what you were thinking?"
- "What support do you need from me?"
- "How often would you like to discuss career progress?"

### Closing
> "I'm committed to helping you grow. Let's check in on this at least once a month. Between now and our next 1:1, I'll draft a development plan for us to review together. Feel free to come to me anytime with questions or if you want to discuss something specific."

## 📋 Essential Manager Habits

### Weekly
- ✅ Observe your ICs in action (meetings, code reviews, design discussions)

- ✅ Identify opportunities that align with ICs' development goals

### Monthly
- ✅ Dedicate at least one 1:1 to career development discussion
- ✅ Review and update development plans
- ✅ Document progress, examples, and areas of growth
- ✅ Seek peer feedback on ICs (informal check-ins)

### Quarterly
- ✅ Deep-dive career conversations with each IC
- ✅ Adjust goals based on progress and changing circumstances
- ✅ Formal peer feedback collection (360 reviews)

- ✅ Promotion decisions and processes
- ✅ Compensation discussions
- ✅ Long-term career planning (3-5 year outlook)

## 🚧 Common Pitfalls for New Managers

### ❌ Waiting Until Review Time
**Don't:** Save all feedback for formal reviews.  
**Do:** Provide continuous, real-time feedback throughout the year.

### ❌ Being Vague
**Don't:** "You need to be more senior."  
**Do:** "To reach Senior level, I'd like to see you leading technical design discussions and mentoring junior developers. Let's work on getting you those opportunities."

### ❌ Making It About You
**Don't:** "I need you to be senior so my team looks stronger."  
**Do:** "What are your career goals, and how can I support you in achieving them?"

### ❌ Avoiding Difficult Conversations
**Don't:** Hope performance issues resolve themselves.  
**Do:** Address concerns early with specific examples and clear expectations.

### ❌ Promoting Too Early
**Don't:** Promote based on potential or to retain someone.  
**Do:** Promote when someone has consistently demonstrated readiness across all key areas.

### ❌ Comparing ICs to Each Other
**Don't:** "You're not as strong as Sarah at this."  
**Do:** "Based on the Senior Developer criteria, here's where I see opportunity for growth..."

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### "How much time should I spend on career development?"

**Minimum:** 
- 30 min/month per IC for direct conversation
- 30 min/month per IC for planning and documentation
- Ongoing observation and feedback (integrated into daily work)

**Realistic:**
- 1 hour/month per IC for direct career work
- Plus informal coaching throughout the week

### "What if an IC doesn't want to progress?"

That's completely valid! Some people are happy at their current level. Your job is to:
- Ensure they maintain performance at that level
- Keep them engaged and learning (even if not pursuing promotion)
- Revisit career goals periodically in case aspirations change
- Support them in deepening expertise at their level

### "What if I don't have opportunities for someone to grow?"

This is a real challenge. Consider:
- Cross-team projects or collaborations
- Temporary assignments to different areas
- Creating new initiatives they can lead
- External learning (conferences, courses, side projects)
- If truly limited, be honest about timing and constraints

### "How do I handle someone who thinks they're ready but isn't?"

- Use the framework to point to specific gaps
- Provide concrete examples of what "ready" looks like
- Show examples of behaviors you're looking for
- Create a clear development plan with milestones
- Check for calibration with other managers
- Be direct but supportive: "Here's the gap, here's how we close it"

### "What if I disagree with how someone was leveled before I arrived?"

- Focus on current state and forward progress
- If you believe they're mis-leveled, gather evidence
- Discuss with your leadership and HR
- If you can't change the level, focus on helping them grow into it or beyond it
- Be transparent with the IC about the situation

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that you've completed this guide:

1. **Read:** [`01_Framework_Overview.md`](01_Framework_Overview.md) - Understand the system
2. **Review:** Career level guides for your ICs
3. **Schedule:** Career-focused 1:1s with your team
4. **Prepare:** Using the 1:1 template and conversation starters
5. **Document:** Start collecting examples and evidence
6. **Practice:** Give feedback regularly, not just at review time

## 💡 Remember

**Your goal is not to promote everyone as fast as possible.** Your goal is to:
- Help each person grow in their chosen direction
- Provide clarity and transparency
- Remove obstacles to development
- Ensure people are engaged and learning
- Build a high-performing team

Some people will race through levels. Others will find their fit and stay there. Both outcomes are successful when people are happy, growing, and delivering value.

**You've got this!** 🎉
