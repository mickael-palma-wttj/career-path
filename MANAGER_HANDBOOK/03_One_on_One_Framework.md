# One-on-One Framework: Career Development Focus

A comprehensive guide to conducting effective 1:1 meetings that drive Individual Contributor career growth.

---

## 🎯 Why 1:1s Matter

One-on-ones are your **most important tool** as a manager for:
- Building trust and psychological safety
- Understanding your IC's aspirations and concerns
- Providing regular feedback and coaching
- Identifying and removing blockers
- Tracking career progress
- Catching issues early

**When done well:** ICs feel supported, grow faster, and stay longer.  
**When done poorly:** ICs feel neglected, plateau, and leave.

## 📅 Frequency & Duration

### Recommended Cadence

| IC Level | Frequency | Duration | Career Focus |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Junior** | Weekly | 30-45 min | Every other week |
| **Confirmed** | Weekly or Bi-weekly | 30 min | Monthly |
| **Senior** | Bi-weekly | 30 min | Monthly |
| **Staff+** | Bi-weekly | 30 min | Bi-monthly |

**Adjust based on:**
- Individual needs and preferences
- Current projects and challenges
- Active development periods
- Performance concerns
- Remote vs. co-located

### Sacred Time Principle

**1:1s should be sacred—don't cancel them.**

If you absolutely must reschedle:
- ✅ Give advance notice
- ✅ Reschedule immediately
- ✅ Explain why (briefly)
- ✅ Make it the exception, not the rule

**Warning signs:**
- You've cancelled 3+ times in 2 months
- ICs stop bringing up important topics
- Relationship feels transactional
- Trust is eroding

## 🏗️ Structure & Agenda

### The 70/30 Rule

**They talk 70% of the time, you talk 30%.**

This is **their meeting**, not yours. Your job is to:

### Basic Meeting Structure

- Challenges they're facing

#### 3. Your Topics (30-40%)
- Feedback you have
- Context to share
- Career development
- Team/org updates

#### 4. Closing (2-3 min)

## 🚧 Handling Difficult Conversations

### When They're Underperforming

**Approach:**
1. **Be direct but kind:** "I need to talk about some concerns I have..."
2. **Be specific:** Use concrete examples with context
3. **Listen:** Understand their perspective
4. **Problem-solve together:** "What would help you improve?"
5. **Create a plan:** Clear expectations and timeline
6. **Follow up:** Regular check-ins on progress

**Example:**
> "I want to discuss the quality of recent PRs. In the last three pull requests [#123, #124, #125], there were significant bugs that made it to production despite code review. This is concerning because it impacts the team's velocity and customer experience. Help me understand what's happening from your perspective. What support do you need to improve the quality before submitting PRs?"

### When They're Unhappy/Disengaged

**Approach:**
1. **Notice and name it:** "You seem less engaged lately..."
2. **Create safety:** "I want to understand what's going on..."
3. **Ask open questions:** "What's changed?"
4. **Listen deeply:** Don't jump to solutions
5. **Explore together:** "What would make this better?"

**Example:**
> "I've noticed that in the past few weeks, you've seemed less engaged in team meetings and your energy feels different. I care about you and want to understand what's happening. Is there something going on with work, or is there a way I can better support you?"

### When They Want to Leave

**Approach:**
1. **Don't panic:** Stay calm and curious
2. **Understand why:** "What's prompting this?"
3. **Be genuine:** "I'd love to keep you if we can address what's wrong"
4. **Don't overpromise:** Only commit to what you can deliver
5. **Respect their decision:** If they've decided, support them

**Example:**
> "Thank you for telling me. I'm sad to hear this, but I appreciate your honesty. Help me understand what's driving this decision. Is there anything that would make you reconsider, or have you already made up your mind? If there are things we could address, I'd like to explore that, but I also respect your decision."

### When You Have to Deliver Bad News

**Approach:**
1. **Be direct:** Don't bury the lead
2. **Be clear:** No ambiguity about the decision
3. **Explain why:** Context helps understanding
4. **Acknowledge impact:** "I know this is disappointing..."
5. **Discuss next steps:** "Here's what happens now..."

**Example:**
> "I need to share some difficult news. We won't be moving forward with your promotion this cycle. The decision came down to [specific reasons]. I know you were hoping for a different outcome, and I understand this is disappointing. Let's talk about what this means and what the path forward looks like."
