# Goal Setting Process: Driving Career Development

A comprehensive guide to setting effective career development goals that align with the IC evaluation framework.

## 🎯 Why Goal Setting Matters

**Effective goals:**
- Provide clarity and direction
- Create accountability
- Enable progress tracking
- Build motivation and engagement
- Connect daily work to career growth
- Make development measurable

**Without clear goals:**
- Development feels random
- Progress is hard to measure
- ICs feel directionless
- Promotion discussions become difficult
- Growth stagnates

## 🎓 SMART Goal Framework

### What Makes a Good Goal?

**S - Specific**
- Clear and unambiguous
- Answers: What, Why, Who, Where, Which

**M - Measurable**
- Quantifiable or clearly observable
- Answers: How much? How many? How will I know it's done?

**A - Achievable**
- Realistic given resources and constraints
- Stretching but not impossible

**R - Relevant**
- Aligns with career path and level expectations
- Matters to their growth and the business

**T - Time-bound**
- Has a deadline or timeframe
- Creates urgency and focus

### Examples: Bad vs. Good Goals

## 🔄 The Goal Setting Process

### Step 1: Reflection (IC prepares)

**Questions for IC to consider:**
- What did I accomplish last quarter/year?
- What went well? What was challenging?
- What do I want to learn or improve?
- Where am I in my career journey?
- What experiences would be valuable?

**Manager provides:**
- Assessment of current level performance
- Observations on strengths/opportunities
- Context on upcoming work
- Career framework expectations

### Step 2: Brainstorming (Together)

**In goal-setting 1:1:**
- IC shares their ideas first
- Manager adds suggestions
- Discuss alignment with career path
- Consider available opportunities
- Think about resources needed

**Generate more ideas than needed** (5-7), then prioritize

### Step 3: Prioritization (Together)

**Consider:**
- What has biggest career impact?
- What aligns with upcoming work?
- What's achievable given time/resources?
- What builds on strengths vs. develops weaknesses?
- What excites the IC most?

**Select 3-4 goals total**
- Quality over quantity
- Better to fully achieve 3 than partially achieve 6

### Step 4: SMART Refinement (Together)

**For each goal:**
- Make it specific
- Define success metrics
- Ensure it's achievable
- Confirm relevance
- Set timeline and milestones

**Document:**
- Goal statement
- Success criteria
- Action steps
- Resources needed
- Manager support
- Check-in dates

### Step 5: Execution Planning (Manager)

**After goal-setting meeting:**
- Identify projects that align
- Create opportunities if needed
- Connect them with resources
- Schedule check-ins
- Share with relevant stakeholders

### Step 6: Regular Review (Monthly)

**In monthly 1:1s:**
- Review progress on each goal
- Celebrate wins
- Address blockers
- Adjust if needed
- Collect evidence

### Step 7: Quarterly Assessment

**End of quarter:**
- Rate each goal (Achieved/Partial/Not Achieved)
- Gather evidence
- Reflect on learnings
- Set next quarter's goals

## 🎯 Special Goal Types

### Stretch Goals

**What:** Goals slightly beyond current capability

**Purpose:** Accelerate growth, build confidence

**How to Set:**
- Should feel uncomfortable but not impossible
- 70% confidence they can achieve it
- Clear support and resources available
- Safe to fail environment

**Example:**
"Lead architecture design for a cross-team project (typically Staff-level work) with close mentorship from Staff engineer"

### Maintenance Goals

**What:** Sustaining current high performance

**Purpose:** Not everything needs to be growth; some goals maintain excellence

**How to Set:**
- For strengths worth preserving
- When growth is focused elsewhere
- To prevent regression

**Example:**
"Continue providing code review feedback within 4 hours, maintaining 95%+ timeliness rate"

### Remediation Goals

**What:** Addressing performance gaps

**Purpose:** Bring underperforming area up to level expectations

**How to Set:**
- Based on specific feedback
- Clear gap to close
- More frequent check-ins
- Manager support critical

**Example:**
"Improve PR quality to meet team standards: reduce blocking comments from avg 8 to <3 per PR over next 8 weeks"

## ⚠️ Common Goal-Setting Pitfalls

### Too Many Goals
**Problem:** Spreads focus too thin, nothing gets deep attention  
**Fix:** Limit to 3-4 meaningful goals per quarter

### Too Vague
**Problem:** Can't measure progress or know when done  
**Fix:** Use SMART framework, specific success criteria

### Not Aligned with Available Work
**Problem:** Goals with no projects to practice on  
**Fix:** Set goals based on upcoming opportunities

### All Weakness-Focused
**Problem:** Demoralizing, ignores leveraging strengths  
**Fix:** Balance growth areas with strength-building

### Set and Forget
**Problem:** Goals written once, never revisited  
**Fix:** Monthly check-ins, quarterly reviews

### Manager-Imposed
**Problem:** IC not bought in, feels like homework  
**Fix:** Collaborative setting, IC leads with their ideas

### No Accountability
**Problem:** No consequences for not pursuing goals  
**Fix:** Regular check-ins, tie to development narrative

## 💡 Tips for Effective Goal Setting

### For Managers

**✅ Do:**
- Let IC drive the goal ideation
- Connect goals to career framework explicitly
- Create opportunities to achieve goals
- Check in regularly, not just at quarter-end
- Celebrate progress and learning
- Adjust goals when circumstances change
- Use goals in promotion discussions

**❌ Don't:**
- Set goals for them without input
- Make every goal a stretch goal
- Ignore goals after they're set
- Punish for not achieving ambitious goals
- Set conflicting or competing goals
- Change goals arbitrarily mid-stream

### For ICs

**✅ Do:**
- Think about what you want to learn
- Be ambitious but realistic
- Own your goals actively
- Ask for help when needed
- Track your own progress
- Speak up if goals need adjustment
- Use goals to guide project choices

**❌ Don't:**
- Set goals just to please manager
- Overcommit to too many goals
- Ignore goals once set
- Be afraid to adjust if not working
- Make them all easy wins
- Work on goals in isolation

## 📊 Tracking & Measuring Progress

### Monthly Progress Check

**For each goal ask:**
1. **Status:** On track / At risk / Blocked
2. **Progress:** What's been done?
3. **Evidence:** What shows progress?
4. **Blockers:** What's in the way?
5. **Next:** What's next step?
6. **Support:** What help is needed?

### Evidence Collection

**Types of evidence:**
- Completed projects/features
- Metrics and data
- Artifacts (docs, code, presentations)
- Peer feedback
- Stakeholder feedback
- Behavioral observations

**Document as you go:**
- Don't wait until quarter-end
- Save links, screenshots, examples
- Get feedback in writing when possible
- Build promotion packet as you grow

### Quarterly Assessment

**For each goal:**
- **Achieved:** Fully met all success criteria
- **Partially Achieved:** Made progress but not complete
- **Not Achieved:** Little to no progress

**For each outcome, ask:**
- What led to this result?
- What went well?
- What was harder than expected?
- What was learned?
- What would we do differently?

**Not achieving a goal ≠ failure**
Sometimes you learn more from ambitious goals you don't fully achieve than safe goals you easily hit.

## 🔄 Adjusting Goals Mid-Stream

### When to Adjust

**Valid reasons:**
- Business priorities shift dramatically
- Project gets cancelled or postponed
- IC changes teams or roles
- Performance issues require different focus
- Opportunity arises that's more valuable
- Goal proves unrealistic or irrelevant

### How to Adjust

1. **Discuss in 1:1:** Don't just change silently
2. **Understand why:** What changed?
3. **Document the change:** Update development plan
4. **Reaffirm commitment:** To adjusted goal
5. **Learn from it:** What does this teach us?

**It's okay to adjust—rigidity is worse than flexibility**
