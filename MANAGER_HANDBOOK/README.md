## 🎯 Key Principles Across All Modules

### 1. **Transparency**
Share the framework openly. ICs benefit from knowing expectations.

### 2. **Fairness & Equity**
Use consistent criteria. Evaluate the work, not the person. Watch for bias.

### 3. **Regular Feedback**
Don't wait for formal reviews. Develop in real-time.

### 4. **Evidence-Based**
Decisions backed by specific examples, not impressions.

### 5. **Development Partnership**
You're a coach, not a controller. IC drives their own growth.

### 6. **Clarity About Constraints**
Be honest about what you can and can't control.

### 7. **Adaptability**
Frameworks are tools, not rules. Adapt to your team and situation.
