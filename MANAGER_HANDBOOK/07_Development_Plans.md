# Development Plans

A comprehensive guide to creating and managing Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for your team members.

---

## What is an Individual Development Plan (IDP)?

An IDP is a structured document that outlines:
- **Current state:** Where the IC is now
- **Future goals:** Where they want to be
- **Development activities:** How they'll get there
- **Timeline:** When they expect to achieve goals
- **Support needed:** What you'll provide

**Purpose:** Make career development intentional, visible, and measurable.

---

## Why Development Plans Matter

**For ICs:**
- Clear roadmap for growth
- Tangible progress tracking
- Aligned expectations with manager
- Motivation and direction

**For Managers:**
- Structure for development conversations
- Documentation for promotion cases
- Accountability for development commitments
- Proactive career management

**For Organization:**
- Pipeline of ready talent
- Reduced attrition
- Skill development aligned with business needs
- Succession planning

---

## When to Create Development Plans

### Initial Plan
- **New hire onboarding:** Within first 30 days
- **New manager relationship:** Within first 1-2 months
- **Career level transition:** Immediately after promotion

### Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly:** Check progress, adjust as needed
- **Annually:** Major refresh aligned with performance cycle
- **Ad-hoc:** When goals or circumstances change significantly

---

## Time Horizons

### Short-term (6 months)
**Focus:** Tactical skill building and immediate improvements

**Typical goals:**
- Master current tools/technologies
- Improve specific weakness
- Deliver stretch project successfully
- Establish new habit (code reviews, documentation)

**Example:**
"Improve code review quality by giving specific, constructive feedback on 10+ PRs per week for 6 months."

### Medium-term (12 months)
**Focus:** Level progression and significant capability building

**Typical goals:**
- Develop next-level skills
- Lead significant projects
- Build broader expertise
- Expand influence

**Example:**
"Lead the API redesign project from discovery through implementation, demonstrating Staff-level technical leadership."

### Long-term (2-3 years)
**Focus:** Career trajectory and major transitions

**Typical goals:**
- Progress to next career level
- Shift to new domain or specialty
- Develop leadership capabilities
- Explore management path

**Example:**
"Progress from Senior to Staff Engineer within 2 years by consistently demonstrating multi-team technical leadership and strategic thinking."

## Creating an Effective IDP

### Step 1: Assessment (Current State)

**Questions to explore:**
1. "What are you doing really well right now?"
2. "What energizes you in your work?"
3. "Where do you see gaps or opportunities for growth?"
4. "What feedback have you received lately?"
5. "What does the framework say about your current level?"

**Map to Framework:**
- Review evaluation criteria together
- Identify strengths and gaps
- Compare to next level requirements

### Step 2: Goal Setting (Future State)

**SMART Goals:**
- **Specific:** Clearly defined outcome
- **Measurable:** Can track progress objectively
- **Achievable:** Challenging but realistic
- **Relevant:** Aligned with career path and business needs
- **Time-bound:** Clear deadline

**Examples of Good Goals:**

✅ "Lead 2 cross-team projects in next 12 months, coordinating with 3+ teams and delivering on schedule."

✅ "Mentor 2 junior engineers for 6 months, meeting weekly and helping them progress measurably."

✅ "Improve system design skills by completing 3 architecture design reviews and implementing one significant system redesign."

**Examples of Poor Goals:**

❌ "Get better at coding" (too vague)

❌ "Learn everything about Kubernetes" (not measurable or bounded)

❌ "Be ready for promotion" (outcome, not development activity)

### Step 3: Development Activities (The Path)

**Types of activities:**

**Stretch Projects:**
- Lead initiatives above current level
- Take ownership of complex problems
- Cross-team collaboration

**Skill Building:**
- Online courses
- Certifications
- Reading (books, papers, documentation)
- Conference attendance

**Practice & Application:**
- Deliberate practice of new skills
- Regular execution of target behaviors
- Shadowing or observing others

**Mentoring & Teaching:**
- Mentor junior team members
- Give tech talks
- Write documentation or blog posts
- Lead workshops

**Feedback & Coaching:**
- Regular 1:1s focused on growth
- Peer feedback collection
- Code review participation
- Retrospectives

### Step 4: Success Criteria (Measuring Progress)

**Define what success looks like:**

**Quantitative measures:**
- "Complete 3 courses by end of Q2"
- "Lead 2 projects to successful delivery"
- "Receive positive feedback from 5+ cross-team stakeholders"

**Qualitative measures:**
- "Demonstrate next-level technical judgment in design reviews"
- "Peers seek me out for guidance on [domain]"
- "Comfortable leading technical discussions with senior engineers"

**Behavioral indicators:**
- "Proactively identify and address technical debt"
- "Regularly contribute to architectural discussions"
- "Mentor others effectively"

### Step 5: Support & Resources (What They Need)

**From Manager:**
- Time allocation (20% for development work)
- Access to projects and opportunities
- Budget (courses, conferences, books)
- Coaching and feedback
- Advocacy and visibility

**From Organization:**
- Training programs
- Mentorship matching
- Internal mobility opportunities
- Tools and resources

**From Peers:**
- Collaboration on stretch projects
- Peer review and feedback
- Knowledge sharing

## Managing Development Plans

### Quarterly Reviews

**Process:**
1. **Week before meeting:** IC reflects on progress, updates doc
2. **Meeting (60-90 min):**
   - Review what's working
   - Identify obstacles
   - Adjust goals if needed
   - Add new activities
   - Recommit or revise
3. **After meeting:** Update shared document with agreed changes

**Key questions:**
- "What progress have you made?"
- "What's going well? What's challenging?"
- "Do these goals still feel right?"
- "What support do you need from me?"
- "Anything to add or change?"

### Annual Refresh

**Full reassessment:**
- Updated framework assessment
- Review past year's achievements
- Set new goals aligned with promotion timeline
- Refresh activities and success criteria
- Realign with business priorities

**Celebrate progress:**
- Acknowledge growth and achievements
- Recognize effort and persistence
- Document readiness for next level

## Connecting IDPs to Promotions

**IDP is the roadmap; promotion is the destination.**

### Building Promotion Case

**IDP provides:**

**Strong promotion packet:**
1. "Here's what [IC] needed to demonstrate" (IDP goals)
2. "Here's how they developed those capabilities" (IDP activities)
3. "Here's the evidence they've achieved next level" (IDP success criteria met)

### Promotion Timeline in IDP

**Example progression (Senior → Staff):**

**Months 0-3:**
- Assess gaps
- Create IDP
- Begin first stretch project

**Months 3-6:**
- Demonstrate Staff-level work on project
- Collect peer feedback
- Refine and continue

**Months 6-12:**
- Consistent next-level performance
- Additional stretch opportunities
- Build promotion evidence

**Month 12:**
- Review promotion readiness
- Submit promotion packet
- Advocate for promotion

**Track in IDP:** "Promotion target: [date], pending consistent demonstration of Staff-level work"

## Documentation Best Practices

### Keep It Living

**Don't:**
❌ Create once and forget
❌ Only update annually
❌ Store in obscure location

**Do:**
✅ Update quarterly (minimum)
✅ Make easily accessible (shared doc)
✅ Reference in every 1:1
✅ Revisit when giving feedback

### Make It Collaborative

**Shared ownership:**
- IC writes and maintains
- Manager reviews and guides
- Both contribute and update

**Shared access:**
- Google Doc or similar
- Both can edit anytime
- Version history preserved

### Use It Actively

**Reference in 1:1s:**
- "How's progress on [IDP goal]?"
- "This project could address [IDP development area]"
- "Let's add this feedback to your IDP"

**Connect to daily work:**
- Assign projects that support IDP
- Give feedback aligned with IDP goals
- Recognize progress toward IDP milestones
