## ⚖️ Alternative Career Paths

### The Management Track
At any point from Senior onwards, ICs can transition to management:
- Senior Developer → Engineering Manager
- Staff Developer → Senior Engineering Manager
- Senior Staff → Director of Engineering
- Principal → VP of Engineering / CTO

**Important:** Management is not a promotion, it's a career change. Different skills, different impact model.

### Lateral Moves
Sometimes the best career move is sideways:
- Senior Backend → Senior Frontend
- Senior Developer → Senior DevOps/Platform
- Senior in Domain A → Senior in Domain B

**Why:** Broaden skills, refresh perspective, find better fit

### Plateauing With Purpose
Many engineers find their "fit level" and stay there:
- Senior Developer who loves hands-on coding
- Staff Engineer who doesn't want organizational politics
- Any level where someone is happy and engaged

**This is completely valid and valuable.**

## 📏 Calibration: How to Know What Level Someone Is

### Evidence-Based Assessment

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Scope:** What's the breadth and depth of their impact?
2. **Autonomy:** How much guidance do they need?
3. **Complexity:** What level of problem do they handle?
4. **Influence:** Who do they impact, and how?
5. **Consistency:** How reliable is their performance?

### Red Flags for Over-Leveling
- Requires frequent guidance for level-appropriate work
- Impact is limited to immediate tasks
- Struggles with ambiguity expected at that level
- Doesn't demonstrate expected leadership/influence
- Inconsistent performance

### Green Flags for Promotion Readiness
- Already performing at next level for 6+ months
- Multiple examples across different contexts
- Peer and stakeholder confirmation
- Consistent pattern, not one-off successes
- Demonstrated growth in development areas
