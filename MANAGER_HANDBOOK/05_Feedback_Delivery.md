# Feedback Delivery: Making Development Actionable

A comprehensive guide to delivering effective feedback that drives growth and performance improvement.

---

## 🎯 Why Feedback Matters

**Effective feedback:**
- Accelerates learning and growth
- Corrects course before small issues become big problems
- Builds trust and psychological safety
- Makes expectations clear
- Increases engagement and performance
- Enables career progression

**Without regular feedback:**
- ICs work blindly without knowing how they're doing
- Small issues compound into performance problems
- Promotion discussions become surprising
- Development is reactive, not proactive
- Trust erodes

**The feedback paradox:** Most people say they want more feedback, but most managers don't give enough. Be the exception.

## 🏗️ Feedback Framework: SBI Model

### S - Situation
Describe the **when and where** of the behavior.

**Why:** Provides context, helps recall the specific instance.

**Example:**
"In yesterday's architecture review meeting..."
"During last week's sprint planning..."
"In the PR you submitted on Monday..."

### B - Behavior
Describe the **observable action** they took.

**Why:** Facts, not interpretations. What you saw/heard, not what you assumed.

**Example:**
"...you interrupted Sarah three times while she was presenting"
"...you provided very detailed code review feedback with specific examples"
"...the code you wrote didn't include any tests"

### I - Impact
Explain the **effect** of that behavior.

**Why:** Helps them understand why it matters, connects action to consequence.

**Example:**
"...which caused Sarah to lose her train of thought and rush through important points"
"...which helped the junior developer learn testing patterns and improved the code quality"
"...which means we can't merge it confidently and it blocks the release"

## 📊 Types of Feedback

### Reinforcing Feedback (Positive)
**Purpose:** Amplify effective behaviors

**When:** When someone does something well that you want to see more of

**Format:**
- SBI: "In [situation], when you [behavior], it [impact]"
- Specific, not generic praise
- Timely, not delayed

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
"In today's production incident, you immediately took charge of the war room, kept everyone calm, and provided clear status updates every 15 minutes. This helped us resolve the issue 40% faster than our average and kept stakeholders informed."

❌ **Bad:**
"Great job on the incident!" (Too vague, no learning)

---

✅ **Good:**
"In your tech spec for the payment system, you included diagrams, considered edge cases, and explicitly called out trade-offs. This made the review process much smoother and helped the team reach consensus quickly."

❌ **Bad:**
"Your doc was good." (No specifics, no impact)

---

### Redirecting Feedback (Constructive/Critical)
**Purpose:** Change ineffective behaviors

**When:** When someone's behavior is hindering their growth or team effectiveness

**Format:**
- SBI + What to do instead
- Delivered with empathy
- Focuses on behavior, not person
- Assumes positive intent

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
"In this week's code reviews, you've approved 5 PRs with just 'LGTM' comments and no substantive feedback. This means we're missing opportunities to catch issues early and help each other learn. Could you spend more time on reviews and provide at least 2-3 specific comments per PR?"

❌ **Bad:**
"Your code reviews are lazy." (Personal attack, no specific behavior)

---

✅ **Good:**
"In the last three sprint plannings, you've stayed quiet when we discuss story estimates, even on stories you'll be working on. This means we might be missing your insights and you might not be aligned on the work. What would help you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts?"

❌ **Bad:**
"You need to speak up more." (Vague, no context, no support)

---

### Coaching Feedback
**Purpose:** Develop capability through questions and guidance

**When:** They're learning something new or tackling stretch work

**Format:**
- Observation + Question
- Guide, don't tell
- Help them discover the answer

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
"I noticed your API design has 15 endpoints for what could be 3 RESTful resources. What patterns have you seen in other APIs you've worked with? How might you simplify this?"

✅ **Good:**
"You mentioned the project is delayed but I haven't seen updated ETAs. How are you communicating status to stakeholders? What information do they need to make decisions?"

---

## 📅 Feedback Timing & Frequency

### Immediate Feedback (Within 24-48 hours)
**When:**
- Significant positive contribution
- Problematic behavior that needs quick correction
- Teachable moment while it's fresh

**Why:** Maximum learning, shows you're paying attention

**Example situations:**
- Great presentation
- Inappropriate comment in meeting
- Clever solution to problem
- Missed deadline without communication

---

### Regular Feedback (Weekly in 1:1s)
**What:**
- Observations from the week
- Progress on development goals
- Small course corrections
- Recognition of efforts

**Why:** Builds habit, prevents surprises, maintains alignment

**Format:** 5-10 minutes of each 1:1

---

### Formal Feedback (Quarterly/Annual)
**What:**
- Comprehensive assessment
- Progress on goals
- Performance level rating
- Career development status

**Why:** Official record, promotion input, compensation decisions

**Format:** Written document + in-depth discussion

---

## 🎭 Feedback by Career Level

### Junior Developer Feedback

**Focus:** Building fundamentals, learning the ropes

**Frequency:** More frequent, more directive

**Balance:** 4:1 ratio of reinforcing to redirecting

**Example topics:**
- Code quality and readability
- Following team conventions
- Asking questions effectively
- Time management
- Communication in standups

**Delivery style:**
- Very specific and concrete
- "Here's how" directive guidance
- Lots of examples
- Paired with resources
- Frequent check-ins

**Sample feedback:**
"In your last 3 PRs, I noticed you're not following our naming conventions for variables (camelCase for local variables). This makes code harder for teammates to read. Here's our style guide [link]. Could you review it and apply it to your next PR?"

---

### Confirmed Developer Feedback

**Focus:** Consistency, expanding scope, independence

**Frequency:** Regular weekly feedback

**Balance:** 3:1 ratio of reinforcing to redirecting

**Example topics:**
- Expanding technical scope
- Taking ownership
- Collaborating across teams
- Mentoring juniors
- Proactive communication

**Delivery style:**
- Mix of directive and coaching
- "Have you considered..." questions
- More autonomy in solutions
- Connect to bigger picture

**Sample feedback:**
"You've been doing great technical work on the user dashboard. I've noticed you haven't yet proactively reached out to the PM or Designer to understand the user needs behind it. Senior developers build context before building code. How might you engage with them to better understand the 'why'?"

---

### Senior Developer Feedback

**Focus:** Technical leadership, mentoring, cross-team impact

**Frequency:** Weekly, but more strategic

**Balance:** 2:1 ratio of reinforcing to redirecting

**Example topics:**
- Architecture decisions
- Technical leadership
- Mentoring effectiveness
- Stakeholder management
- Strategic thinking

**Delivery style:**
- Primarily coaching questions
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Focus on influence and impact
- Connect to organizational goals

**Sample feedback:**
"I've seen you write excellent technical specs that are very thorough. However, I noticed in the last architecture review, several people seemed confused by the depth. At Senior level, one skill is adapting communication to your audience. How might you create a shorter executive summary for non-technical stakeholders while keeping the detailed version for engineers?"

---

### Staff+ Developer Feedback

**Focus:** Organizational impact, strategic influence, multiplier effect

**Frequency:** Regular but high-level

**Balance:** 1:1 ratio (they should have strong self-awareness)

**Example topics:**
- Technical strategy and vision
- Cross-org collaboration
- Growing other leaders
- Organizational process improvements
- Business impact

**Delivery style:**
- Peer-to-peer conversation
- "What I'm observing" reflections
- Challenge their thinking
- Focus on leverage and scale

**Sample feedback:**
"I've noticed you've been deep in the implementation of the observability system for the past two months. That's important work, but I want to check in on whether that's the highest leverage use of your time as a Staff engineer. Are there parts that could be delegated? How are you balancing hands-on work with the broader strategic initiatives we discussed?"

## 🗣️ Delivering Difficult Feedback

### The Feedback Conversation Structure

**1. Setup (2 minutes)**
- Schedule dedicated time, don't surprise them
- Choose private setting
- Clear your calendar so you're not rushed
- Have specific examples ready

**2. Opening (1 minute)**
State the purpose clearly:
- "I want to talk about [specific topic]"
- "I have some feedback about [behavior]"
- Assume positive intent
- Reassure this is developmental

**3. SBI Delivery (3-5 minutes)**
- State the Situation
- Describe the Behavior (facts, not judgments)
- Explain the Impact
- **Pause. Let them process.**

**4. Listen (5-10 minutes)**
- Ask: "What's your perspective?"
- Listen more than you talk
- Seek to understand, not defend
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Ask clarifying questions

**5. Collaborate on Solution (5-10 minutes)**
- Ask: "What would you like to do differently?"
- Add your suggestions
- Agree on specific next steps
- Offer support
- Set follow-up

**6. Closing (1 minute)**
- Reaffirm confidence in them
- Thank them for openness
- Document key points

**Total: 20-30 minutes**

### Example: Difficult Feedback Conversation

**Situation:** Senior developer is not mentoring effectively

**Opening:**
"Thanks for making time. I want to talk about your mentoring of Alex. I know developing others is new for you and I want to support you in growing this skill."

**SBI:**
"Over the past month, I've noticed that when Alex asks you questions [situation], you often give them the answer directly rather than helping them work through the problem [behavior]. While this is efficient in the short term, it means Alex isn't developing problem-solving skills and continues to be dependent on you [impact]. I've heard from Alex that they appreciate your help but wish they understood the 'why' more."

**Pause. Wait for response.**

**Listen:**
"What's your take on this?"

[Listen to their perspective. Maybe they say: "I didn't realize. I'm just trying to help them move faster because we have tight deadlines."]

**Acknowledge:**
"I appreciate that you're trying to balance their development with delivering the project. That's a real tension."

**Collaborate:**
"As a Senior developer, one of your goals is to multiply your impact through others. What if we tried a different approach? When Alex asks a question, what if you first asked them what they've tried, then guided them with questions rather than answers? This might take 5 minutes instead of 2 minutes initially, but over time Alex will get faster and you'll save time."

[Discuss, refine]

**Commit:**
"So let's try this for the next two weeks: use a coaching approach with Alex on technical questions. I'll check in with you next week to see how it's going and hear what's working or what's challenging. Sound good?"

**Close:**
"I know this is a learning curve for you too, and that's completely normal. Mentoring is a skill we develop over time. I have confidence you'll grow this. Thanks for being open to the feedback."

## 💭 Feedback Mindsets

### Growth Mindset Feedback

**Assumes:**
- Skills are developable
- Failure is learning
- Effort leads to mastery

**Language:**
- "You're still developing this skill..."
- "This is a growth area..."
- "With practice, you'll..."
- "What did you learn from this?"

**Effect:** Encourages experimentation, resilience

---

### Fixed Mindset Feedback (Avoid)

**Assumes:**
- Talent is innate
- Failure reflects inability
- Either you have it or you don't

**Language:**
- "You're just not good at..."
- "Some people are naturally..."
- "This isn't your strength..."
- "You always..."

**Effect:** Discourages risk-taking, breeds defensiveness

---

## 🎯 Making Feedback Actionable

### From Vague to Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Your communication needs improvement"

✅ **Specific:** "When you send status updates, include: (1) what's done, (2) what's in progress, (3) any blockers, and (4) expected completion dates. This helps stakeholders make decisions without follow-up questions."

---

❌ **Vague:** "Be more proactive"

✅ **Specific:** "When you see a potential issue, raise it immediately rather than waiting for someone to ask. For example, when you realized the API wouldn't be ready on time, I wish you'd flagged it three days earlier so we could adjust plans."

---

❌ **Vague:** "Take more ownership"

✅ **Specific:** "For the next project you lead, I'd like to see you: (1) define success criteria upfront, (2) provide weekly status updates without being asked, (3) proactively identify risks and mitigation plans. Let's discuss how to do this."

---

### Include "Do This Instead"

**Not just what's wrong, but what right looks like**

**Example:**
"I noticed you introduced a new library without discussing it with the team first [behavior]. This led to questions about our tech stack consistency and we had to spend time retroactively discussing whether it was the right choice [impact]. **Going forward, for significant technical decisions like this, please: (1) write a brief tech proposal, (2) share it in #engineering-architecture for feedback, (3) wait 48 hours for comments before proceeding. This way we benefit from collective wisdom and maintain alignment.**"

## 📝 Feedback Documentation

### When to Document

**Always document:**
- Performance issues
- Improvement plans
- Formal reviews
- Promotion discussions
- Repeated patterns

**Consider documenting:**
- Significant achievements
- Developmental feedback
- Skill demonstrations
- Growth milestones

**No need to document:**
- Minor in-the-moment corrections
- Routine positive feedback
- Everyday coaching

### How to Document

**Format:**
- Date
- SBI framework
- Agreement on next steps
- Follow-up date

**Example:**

```
Date: 2024-03-15
Topic: Code Review Quality

Situation: In the past 2 weeks of code reviews (3/1-3/15)

Behavior: Provided 'LGTM' approval on 8 PRs without substantive feedback; missed 3 significant issues that were later caught in QA

Impact: Reduced code quality, undermined our peer review process, delayed releases due to issues found late

Discussion: Discussed expectations for thorough code reviews. Employee acknowledged rushing reviews due to feature work pressure.

Action Plan:
- Limit to 3 meaningful reviews per day to allow time
- Use code review checklist
- Provide at least 2 substantive comments per review
- Manager to spot-check reviews for next 2 weeks

Follow-up: 3/29 - Check progress on review quality
```

**Store in:** Development plan, manager notes, performance file

## 🚫 Feedback Pitfalls to Avoid

### The Feedback Sandwich (Compliment-Criticism-Compliment)

**Why it fails:**
- Dilutes the message
- Feels manipulative
- People start waiting for "but"
- Positive feedback seems insincere

**Do instead:** Be direct. Give positive feedback when earned. Give critical feedback when needed. Don't bundle them artificially.

---

### Delayed Feedback

**Problem:** "Six months ago you..."

**Why it fails:**
- Can't remember specifics
- Can't course-correct in time
- Feels unfair ("Why didn't you tell me then?")

**Do instead:** Timely feedback, ideally within 48 hours

---

### Vague Language

**Problem:** "You need to be more senior"

**Why it fails:**
- Not actionable
- Unclear what to change
- Feels like judgment not coaching

**Do instead:** Use SBI, be specific, give examples

---

### Feedback in Public

**Problem:** Correcting someone in front of team

**Why it fails:**
- Embarrasses them
- Damages trust
- Others fear speaking up

**Do instead:** "Praise in public, redirect in private"

---

### Assuming Intent

**Problem:** "You did X because you don't care about quality"

**Why it fails:**
- Mind reading
- Puts them defensive
- Likely wrong

**Do instead:** Describe behavior and impact, ask about their reasoning

---

### Only Negative Feedback

**Problem:** Only speaking up when there's a problem

**Why it fails:**
- Demoralizing
- Doesn't reinforce what to keep doing
- Damages relationship

**Do instead:** 3:1 ratio of positive to critical feedback

---

### Feedback Without Context

**Problem:** "That presentation wasn't great"

**Why it fails:**
- What specifically?
- Compared to what standard?
- What should change?

**Do instead:** Use SBI + expectations + next steps

---

## 💡 Advanced Feedback Techniques

### The "What I'm Noticing" Approach

**Use when:** You're seeing a pattern but not sure of cause

**Format:**
"I'm noticing [pattern]. Help me understand what's happening."

**Example:**
"I'm noticing you've shifted three deadlines in the past month without explaining why. Help me understand what's going on. Are the estimates off? Is something blocking you? Do you need support?"

**Why it works:** Opens dialogue without accusation, assumes partnership

---

### The "I Need Your Help" Frame

**Use when:** You want them to take ownership of solution

**Format:**
"I need your help with [problem]. What ideas do you have?"

**Example:**
"I need your help improving our team's documentation practices. You're the most experienced with our system. What do you think we should do? Would you be willing to lead this?"

**Why it works:** Positions them as capable, invites collaboration

---

### The "Feedforward" Approach

**Use when:** Looking ahead rather than backwards

**Format:**
Focus on what to do next time, not what went wrong last time

**Example:**
Instead of: "You should have written tests for that feature"
Try: "For the next feature, let's make sure to write tests before the code review. What testing approach makes sense?"

**Why it works:** Forward-looking, less defensive, more actionable

---

### The "What Else?" Follow-up

**Use when:** You want them to self-reflect more deeply

**Format:**
After they give an answer, ask "What else?"

**Example:**
You: "How do you think that presentation went?"
Them: "I think it went well. People asked good questions."
You: "What else did you notice?"
Them: "Well, I did lose track of time and rushed the ending..."
You: "What else?"
Them: "And I didn't really prepare for questions about scalability..."

**Why it works:** Helps them dig deeper, develop self-awareness

---

## 🎤 Receiving Feedback as a Manager

### Model What You Expect

**Ask for feedback regularly:**
- "What's one thing I could do better as your manager?"
- "How can I better support your development?"
- "What should I stop/start/continue doing?"

**When you receive feedback:**
- Listen without defending
- Thank them sincerely
- Ask clarifying questions
- Act on it (or explain why not)
- Follow up to show you heard

**Model growth mindset:**
- Admit mistakes
- Share what you're learning
- Show vulnerability

**Why:** Creates psychological safety, builds trust, normalizes feedback

---

## 📊 Feedback Effectiveness Metrics

### Are You Giving Enough Feedback?

**Ask yourself monthly:**
- [ ] Have I given each direct report reinforcing feedback this week?
- [ ] Have I addressed performance issues within 48 hours?
- [ ] Am I providing feedback in 1:1s weekly?
- [ ] Am I documenting significant feedback?
- [ ] Are people making progress on their development goals?

### Is Your Feedback Working?

**Signs it's working:**
- ICs explicitly apply feedback you gave
- Behaviors improve over time
- ICs seek feedback proactively
- Performance gaps close
- People thank you for feedback

**Signs it's not working:**
- Same issues keep recurring
- ICs seem surprised by formal reviews
- Defensive reactions
- No visible behavior change
- People avoid feedback conversations

**If feedback isn't working:**
- Check your ratio (enough positive feedback?)
- Assess specificity (concrete enough?)
- Review timing (too delayed?)
- Consider delivery (too harsh? too soft?)
- Seek feedback on your feedback

## 🎯 Quick Reference: SBI Examples by Situation

### Code Quality

**Reinforcing:**
"In your PR for the authentication service [S], you included comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and documented edge cases [B]. This gave the team confidence to merge quickly and caught two potential security issues [I]."

**Redirecting:**
"In your last three PRs [S], there were no tests included and several linting errors [B]. This meant reviewers had to ask for changes multiple times and delayed merges by 2-3 days [I]. Please run linters and write tests before submitting PRs."

---

### Communication

**Reinforcing:**
"In yesterday's planning meeting [S], you asked clarifying questions about user needs before jumping to technical solutions [B]. This helped us avoid building the wrong thing and saved us at least a week of rework [I]."

**Redirecting:**
"During the past two weeks [S], you haven't provided status updates on the analytics project [B]. This has left stakeholders uncertain and they've been asking me for updates [I]. Could you send brief weekly updates on Slack?"

---

### Collaboration

**Reinforcing:**
"When Sarah was struggling with the database migration last week [S], you proactively offered to pair with her and shared your migration script [B]. She told me this unblocked her and she learned patterns she can reuse [I]. This is exactly the kind of collaboration we value."

**Redirecting:**
"In Monday's code review [S], you left a comment saying 'this is wrong' without explaining why [B]. The author felt discouraged and wasn't sure how to improve it [I]. Could you explain the reasoning and suggest alternatives in future reviews?"

---

### Leadership

**Reinforcing:**
"In last week's incident [S], you organized the team, delegated clearly, and kept everyone calm under pressure [B]. We resolved it 50% faster than our average and no one panicked [I]. That's the kind of leadership we need."

**Redirecting:**
"In the architecture meeting [S], you dismissed the junior developer's suggestion without exploring it [B]. They mentioned to me later that they felt unheard and hesitant to share ideas now [I]. As a senior engineer, how can you encourage participation from less experienced teammates?"

---

**Use these as templates—adapt the SBI components to your specific situations.**
