## Scenario 1: IC Feels Stuck

### Situation
IC has been at same level for extended period and feels they're not progressing.

### Common Causes
- **Actually stuck:** Not performing at next level
- **Unclear expectations:** Doesn't know what next level requires
- **No opportunities:** Team too small or work not complex enough
- **Genuine plateau:** At right level for their capabilities/interest

### Approaches

**Approach 1: Diagnose the Gap**

1. **Assessment conversation:**
   "Let's look at the framework together. Where do you think you are on these criteria?"

2. **Compare to next level:**
   "Here's what Staff level requires. Here's where I see you currently. The gap is [specific areas]."

3. **Create development plan:**
   "Here's what we need to focus on over next 6-12 months..."

**When to use:** IC wants to progress but unclear on path.

**Approach 2: Create Opportunities**

1. **Identify growth projects:**
   "To demonstrate Staff-level work, you need to lead cross-team initiatives. Let's create that opportunity."

2. **Expand scope:**
   "I'm going to give you ownership of [larger area] where you can show next-level capability."

3. **Connect cross-team:**
   "I'll introduce you to [other team] for collaboration opportunity."

**When to use:** IC has capability but lacks opportunity to demonstrate it.

**Approach 3: Reality Check**

1. **Be honest about timeline:**
   "Based on framework, you're 12-18 months from ready. That's normal, not stuck."

2. **Or about plateau:**
   "You're a strong Senior. Not everyone progresses to Staff, and that's okay. Let's talk about keeping your work interesting and challenging."

3. **Or about constraints:**
   "Our team doesn't have Staff-level scope. To progress, you'd need to transfer to [larger team]. Want to explore that?"

**When to use:** Expectations need calibration.

### Red Flags
🚩 Promising promotion without evidence
🚩 Avoiding honest feedback
🚩 Blaming IC for systemic issues

## Scenario 2: Mismatch Between Self-Assessment and Reality

### Situation
IC rates themselves significantly higher than your assessment (e.g., they see 4.0, you see 2.5).

### Common Causes
- **Lack of awareness:** Dunning-Kruger effect
- **Different standards:** Comparing to wrong peers
- **Visibility gap:** You're not seeing their work
- **Defensive reaction:** Feels undervalued

### Approaches

**Approach 1: Evidence-Based Discussion**

1. **Ask for their reasoning:**
   "You've rated yourself 4.0. Walk me through what led you to that rating."

2. **Share specific examples:**
   "Here's what I've observed: [concrete behaviors]. Based on framework, that's ~2.5."

3. **Use framework as neutral reference:**
   "Let's look at level 4.0 description together. Does this match what you're doing?"

**When to use:** Most situations—leads to shared understanding.

**Approach 2: Investigate Blind Spots**

1. **Check if you're missing their work:**
   "Tell me about work you've done that I might not be aware of."

2. **Collect peer feedback:**
   "Let's get input from people you work with to triangulate."

3. **Adjust if warranted:**
   "You're right, I wasn't seeing [X]. That changes my assessment."

**When to use:** You suspect you may not have full picture.

**Approach 3: Show Comparison**

1. **Point to examples:**
   "Sarah is at 4.0. Here's what her work looks like. How does yours compare?"

2. **Highlight the gap:**
   "The difference is [specific capabilities]. That's the gap we need to close."

**When to use:** IC needs clearer mental model of levels.

### Red Flags
🚩 Dismissing their perspective without listening
🚩 Getting defensive or frustrated
🚩 Avoiding the hard conversation

**When to use:** Early exploration phase.

**Approach 2: Show IC Leadership Path**

1. **Explain Staff+ track:**
   "You can have significant impact and leadership as Staff+ IC. Here's what that looks like..."

2. **Show both paths:**

3. **Let them decide:**
   "After trying mentorship and leading technical initiatives, which energizes you more?"

**When to use:** Want to ensure they know alternatives.

**Approach 3: Create Management Opportunity**

1. **If right fit:**

3. **Get training:**
   "Take management fundamentals course and shadow me in 1:1s."

**When to use:** They show genuine aptitude and interest.
