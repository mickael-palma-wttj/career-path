# Promotion Readiness: Evaluating and Advocating

A comprehensive guide to assessing promotion readiness, building evidence, and successfully advocating for your team members.

---

## 🎯 What is Promotion Readiness?

**Promotion readiness** means an IC is **consistently performing at the next level** for a sustained period, with evidence to prove it.

**Key principles:**
- Promotion recognizes work **already being done**, not potential
- It's about **sustained performance**, not one-time achievements
- Evidence must be **concrete and documented**
- Must demonstrate **all three pillars** at the next level
- Timing matters—there's "ready" and "promotable now"

**Common misconception:** "They've been here 2 years, time for promotion"
**Reality:** Time is not a criterion. Performance at the next level is.

---

## 📊 Promotion vs. Performance

### Performance: Meeting Current Level
- Doing the job you're hired for
- Recognized through comp increases, bonuses
- Expected consistency

### Promotion: Exceeding to Next Level
- Consistently operating at next level
- Expanding scope and impact
- Demonstrating new capabilities
- Ready for more responsibility

**Analogy:** You don't get promoted for being great at your job. You get promoted for already doing the next job.

---

## 🏗️ The Promotion Readiness Framework

### Three Required Components

#### 1. **Consistent Performance at Next Level**
- Not just once, but repeatedly
- Typically 3-6 months of sustained evidence
- Across multiple dimensions

#### 2. **Evidence Across All Three Pillars**
- Engineering Craft ✓
- Soft Skills ✓
- Leadership ✓
- Can't promote based on one strength alone

#### 3. **Business Need and Opportunity**
- Company has role at that level
- Budget and headcount available
- Work available at that scope

**All three must be present** for successful promotion.

---

## ⏱️ Typical Promotion Timelines

### Junior → Confirmed Developer
**Typical timeline:** 12-24 months  
**What's needed:** Consistent, quality execution without constant guidance

**Red flags if faster:**
- Skipped foundational learning
- Haven't encountered enough complexity

**Red flags if slower:**
- May need more support structures
- Performance gaps to address

---

### Confirmed → Senior Developer
**Typical timeline:** 2-4 years  
**What's needed:** Technical leadership, mentoring, cross-team impact

**Red flags if faster:**
- May not have built enough depth
- Leadership skills undertested

**Red flags if slower:**
- Might be plateauing
- Consider if path fits their strengths

---

### Senior → Staff Developer
**Typical timeline:** 3-5+ years  
**What's needed:** Organizational impact, technical strategy, multiplier effect

**Red flags if faster:**
- Exceptional talent (rare but happens)
- Verify depth of impact

**Red flags if slower:**
- Perfectly normal
- Staff roles require unique opportunities
- Not everyone reaches Staff

---

### Staff → Senior Staff/Principal
**Typical timeline:** 4-7+ years  
**What's needed:** Cross-org influence, company-level impact, technical vision

**Important notes:**
- These are rare promotions
- Requires exceptional circumstances
- Company must have need and scope
- Many excellent Staff engineers never reach beyond

**Not reaching Staff+ ≠ failure**

---

## 📋 Assessing Promotion Readiness

### Step 1: Review Framework Expectations

**For each criterion at target level:**
- What's the expectation?
- What's the weight in the framework?
- How is this different from current level?

**Example: Junior → Confirmed**

| Criterion | Junior | Confirmed | Gap to Close |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Code Quality | Writes working code with guidance | Writes quality code independently | Autonomy and quality |
| Testing | Basic happy-path tests | Comprehensive test coverage | Depth of testing |
| Ownership | Completes assigned tasks | Owns features end-to-end | Scope expansion |

---

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

**For each criterion, collect:**

**1. Project Examples**
- What did they deliver?
- At what scope?
- With what level of guidance?

**2. Behavioral Examples**
- How did they demonstrate the skill?
- Specific situations (SBI)
- Observable impact

**3. Peer Feedback**
- What do colleagues say?
- Who have they helped?
- What's their reputation?

**4. Metrics and Data**
- Quantifiable outcomes
- Business impact
- Quality measures

**Document as you go throughout the year**—don't scramble at promotion time.

---

### Step 3: Apply the "Consistently" Test

**Ask for each criterion:**
- Have they demonstrated this **multiple times**?
- Across **different situations**?
- Over **several months**?
- Without **regressions**?

**One-time achievements ≠ consistent performance**

**Example:**

❌ **Not Consistent:**
"Led one complex project successfully 8 months ago, but recent projects have needed significant guidance"

✅ **Consistent:**
"Led 4 complex projects over the past 6 months with minimal guidance, delivering on time with quality"

---

### Step 4: Check All Three Pillars

**For each pillar at target level:**

#### Engineering Craft
- [ ] Technical skills match expectations
- [ ] Quality consistently at next level
- [ ] Scope appropriate for next level
- [ ] Complexity handled independently

#### Soft Skills
- [ ] Communication effective for next level
- [ ] Collaboration across appropriate scope
- [ ] Proactivity and initiative present
- [ ] Business context demonstrated

#### Leadership
- [ ] Influence appropriate for next level
- [ ] Mentoring/support of others
- [ ] Process improvements
- [ ] Team/org impact

**If any pillar is significantly weak, not ready yet.**

---

### Step 5: Write the Promotion Narrative

**Format:**
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Performance at Current Level
3. Evidence of Next Level Performance
4. Specific Examples for Each Pillar
5. Peer Feedback
6. Recommendation

**Example Narrative Structure:**

```markdown

## 🗣️ Promotion Conversations

### When IC Asks: "Am I ready for promotion?"

**If Not Ready (Red):**

❌ **Don't say:**
"Not yet." (Too vague)
"You need more experience." (Unhelpful)

✅ **Do say:**
"Here's where you are: You're strong at [X] and developing [Y]. To be ready for promotion to [level], I need to see consistent evidence of [specific criteria]. Let's create a plan to get you there over the next [timeframe]. Here are the specific opportunities coming up..."

**Be specific, supportive, create a plan.**

---

**If Emerging (Yellow):**

❌ **Don't say:**
"Maybe soon." (Creates false hope)

✅ **Do say:**
"You're on track. Over the past [time], I've seen you demonstrate [next level work examples]. To be ready for promotion, I need to see this sustained for another [3-6 months] across [areas]. You're progressing well. Let's talk about upcoming opportunities to showcase these skills."

**Encourage, but set realistic timeline.**

---

**If Ready (Green):**

❌ **Don't say:**
"Let's see what happens in the promotion cycle." (Vague)

✅ **Do say:**
"Yes, you're ready. You've consistently demonstrated [level] performance for [time period] across [pillars]. I'm going to advocate for your promotion in [next cycle]. Here's the process and timeline: [explain]. I'm confident, but I can't guarantee the outcome. Let me show you the evidence I'm presenting..."

**Be clear, explain process, manage expectations about outcomes.**

---

**If Overdue (Green but delayed):**

❌ **Don't say:**
"It's out of my hands." (Abdicates responsibility)

✅ **Do say:**
"You are absolutely ready and have been for [time]. The delay is not about your performance—it's due to [specific reason: budget/timing/headcount]. I am actively advocating for you and here's what I'm doing: [specific actions]. I know this is frustrating, and I want to keep you here, so let's also discuss [comp adjustment/special projects/other recognition] while we work through this."

**Acknowledge frustration, be transparent, show action.**

---

### When You Need to Say: "You're not on promotion track"

**Situation:** IC thinks they're ready, but they're not close.

**Approach:**

1. **Acknowledge perception gap**
"I hear that you feel ready for promotion. I want to understand your thinking, and then share my perspective."

2. **Listen first**
"What makes you feel you're ready?" (Understand their reasoning)

3. **Be direct and specific**
"I appreciate your perspective. From my view, here's where you are: [current level assessment]. For promotion to [next level], I need to see [specific gaps]. Right now, I'm seeing [specific examples of where performance is at current level, not next]."

4. **Create a development plan**
"Let's create a clear plan to close these gaps. Here's what success looks like: [specific criteria]. Here are the opportunities to demonstrate this: [projects/initiatives]. Let's check in [monthly] on progress."

5. **Set timeline**
"If we see sustained progress, I'd expect promotion readiness in [realistic timeframe, typically 6-12+ months]."

**Be honest, specific, and supportive. Don't give false hope.**

### What Makes Evidence Strong?

**Strong evidence:**
✅ Specific projects with metrics
✅ Multiple examples over time
✅ Clear scope and complexity
✅ Observable impact
✅ Third-party validation

**Weak evidence:**
❌ Vague descriptions
❌ One-time occurrences
❌ Potential, not performance
❌ Manager opinion only
❌ No measurable impact

**Example Comparison:**

❌ **Weak:**
"Alex is a great developer who writes quality code and works well with others. They're ready for the next level."

✅ **Strong:**
"Over the past 6 months, Alex led 3 complex projects requiring cross-team coordination:
- User Analytics Dashboard: Delivered 2 weeks early, handling 1M+ events/day, 0 production issues in 4 months. Product team cited their collaboration as exemplary.
- API v3 Migration: Successfully migrated 8 services with zero downtime. Created migration playbook used by 3 other teams.
- Performance Optimization: Reduced page load times by 40%, directly improving user conversion by 2.3% (measured by A/B test), saving ~$500K annually in infrastructure costs.

Feedback from cross-functional partners: [3 specific quotes from PM, Designer, Platform engineer]

This demonstrates Senior-level technical ownership, business impact, and cross-team leadership."

## 🚧 Common Promotion Blockers

### 1. "Great at current level, but not showing next level yet"

**What it means:** Doing excellent work, but not expanding scope

**How to address:**
- Create stretch opportunities
- Assign next-level projects
- Coach on what next level looks like
- Give explicit permission to work at next level

---

### 2. "Strong in 1-2 pillars, weak in third"

**What it means:** Technical star but poor communicator, or great collaborator but technical gaps

**How to address:**
- Focused development on weak pillar
- Can't promote until all three pillars are ready
- May need 6-12 months of targeted growth

---

### 3. "Inconsistent performance"

**What it means:** Capable but not sustained, or one great project but otherwise average

**How to address:**
- Need more time to demonstrate consistency
- Address any performance issues
- Track progress over 3-6 months

---

### 4. "Company doesn't have scope/budget"

**What it means:** IC is ready but no role/budget available

**How to address:**
- Be transparent with IC
- Advocate strongly to leadership
- Consider compensation adjustments
- Help them find opportunities outside if truly stuck

---

### 5. "Too fast—not enough time at level"

**What it means:** May have promoted too early before, or skipping learning

**How to address:**
- Evaluate if truly demonstrating next level consistently
- If yes, advocate for exception
- If no, develop intentionally over more time

---

## 📊 Promotion Success Metrics

### For Individual ICs

**Promotion success:**
- IC continues to perform well at new level
- No "promotion regret"
- Continued growth trajectory

**Promotion failure:**

---

## 🗣️ Example Promotion Conversations

### Example 1: Ready for Promotion

**Manager:** "I wanted to talk about your career progression. Over the past 7 months, I've seen you consistently operate at Senior level. You've led complex projects, mentored team members, and collaborated across teams effectively. I'm going to put you forward for promotion in next month's cycle."

**IC:** "Really? I wasn't sure if I was ready."

**Manager:** "Let me show you the evidence I've been tracking. [Reviews packet highlights]. You've demonstrated all the criteria for Senior level multiple times. I'm confident you're ready. Now, I can't guarantee the outcome—there's a calibration process and budget considerations—but I believe you have a strong case."

**IC:** "What happens if it doesn't go through?"

**Manager:** "If it's deferred, we'll get specific feedback on what's needed and the timeline. But based on what I'm seeing, I'm optimistic. Either way, I want you to know that you're performing at that level and I recognize that."

---

### Example 2: Not Ready Yet

**Manager:** "I know career growth is important to you. Let's talk about where you are and what it takes to get to Senior level."

**IC:** "I feel like I've been doing Senior-level work for a while now."

**Manager:** "Tell me more about what makes you feel that way."

**IC:** "I led the payment refactor project, which was complex."

**Manager:** "That was great work, and it was Senior-level complexity. Here's my perspective: promotion requires consistently performing at next level across all areas. While the payment project showed Senior capability, the projects before and after have needed more guidance. I need to see that level of ownership consistently over 3-6 months, not just once. Also, Senior level requires mentoring others—that's an area we haven't focused on yet."

**IC:** "So what do I need to do?"

**Manager:** "Let's create a specific plan. Over the next 6 months, I want to see:
1. Leading 2-3 more projects at that complexity with minimal guidance
2. Taking on mentoring a Confirmed developer
3. Proactively driving technical decisions in your domain

I'll create these opportunities for you. We'll check in monthly on progress. Does that make sense?"

**IC:** "Yes, that's helpful to know specifically what I need to demonstrate."

---

### Example 3: Overdue Promotion

**Manager:** "I want to be transparent about your promotion. You've been ready for Senior level for over 6 months. Your performance is absolutely there—you're consistently delivering at that level. However, the company has paused Senior promotions this quarter due to budget constraints."

**IC:** "That's frustrating. I've been working toward this."

**Manager:** "I completely understand the frustration, and I want you to know this is not about your performance at all. You deserve to be promoted. Here's what I'm doing: I've escalated to my manager and to HR. I'm documenting your case so when the promotion cycle reopens, yours is first in line. In the meantime, I'm also advocating for a compensation adjustment to reflect your work even before the title change."

**IC:** "I appreciate that. How long until the next cycle?"

**Manager:** "The next promotion cycle is in 4 months. I'm committed to getting you promoted then. I also want to check in—are you okay waiting that timeline? I want to be honest that if this were affecting your decision to stay, I'd want to know so I can escalate further."
