# Retention Strategies

A comprehensive guide to keeping your high-performing team members engaged, growing, and committed.

## Why Retention Matters

**Cost of Attrition:**
- Recruiting costs (time, money, opportunity cost)
- Lost productivity (ramp-up time for replacement)
- Knowledge loss (institutional knowledge, relationships)
- Team disruption (morale impact, remaining workload)
- Reputation damage (harder to attract talent)

**Reality:** Replacing a senior engineer can cost 6-12 months of salary and take 6+ months to get new hire to full productivity.

**Better to invest in keeping great people.**

**Don't:**
❌ Ignore the signs
❌ Wait for them to come to you

**Opening:**
"I've noticed you seem less engaged lately. I want to check in—how are you feeling about work right now?"

**Listen deeply:**
- Let them talk without interrupting

**Explore specifics:**
- "What specifically is frustrating you?"
- "What would need to change?"
- "Is this something we can address?"
- "Have you thought about leaving?"

**Be direct if needed:**
"I value you on this team and want to keep you. If you're considering leaving, I'd like the chance to see if we can fix things. Can you be honest with me about where you're at?"

### Stage 3: Assessment

**After the conversation, evaluate:**

**Fixable issues:**
- Growth opportunities (can provide)
- Project assignments (can change)
- Work environment (can improve)
- Recognition (can increase)
- Manager support (can enhance)

**Difficult but possible:**

**Decide: Is it worth fighting for retention?**

### Stage 4: Building the Response

**3. Timeline commitment**
- "Here's what I can do by [date]"

- Be specific, not vague

### Stage 5: The Response Conversation

**Present clearly:**
"You shared [issues]. I've worked with leadership and here's what we can do:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Timeline commitments]"

**Be honest:**
"This is what I can offer. Here's what I can't do: [constraints]"

**Ask for commitment:**
"If we do these things, will you commit to staying and giving this a fair shot?"

**Respect their decision:**
"I understand if this doesn't address everything. Take time to think about it."

### Stage 6: Follow Through

**If they stay:**

**Deliver immediately:**
- Start promised changes within days
- Show visible progress
- Check in frequently
- Demonstrate commitment

**Monitor closely:**
- Weekly check-ins for first month
- Monthly for next 3 months

## Special Scenarios

### High Performer with Competing Offer

**They come to you:**
"I have an offer for [significantly more money / better role]. I wanted to talk to you before deciding."

**Response framework:**

**1. Appreciate the honesty**
"Thank you for coming to me. I value that you're giving me the opportunity to respond."

**2. Understand the full picture**
- What's the offer? (comp, role, company)
- Why is it appealing?
- What would make them stay?
- How seriously are they considering it?

**3. Assess quickly (24-48 hours)**
- Can we match or beat?
- Should we match or beat?
- Is this about money or something else?

**4. Make informed decision**

**Option A: Counter-offer**
"We don't want to lose you. Here's what we can do: [specific package]. Can I ask you to seriously consider staying?"

**Option B: Graceful exit**
"I understand why that offer is compelling. While I'd love to keep you, I can see why this is the right move for you. Let's make this transition as smooth as possible."

**⚠️ Counter-offer risks:**
- May not address underlying issues
- Could create resentment ("had to get offer to get raise")
- May just delay departure
- Can set precedent for others

**Only counter if:**
✅ Genuinely worth keeping

**See:** [Specialized Situations FAQ](../FAQS/10_Specialized_Situations.md) - Deep specialists

### Burnout Risk

**Symptoms:**
- Exhaustion
- Cynicism
- Reduced effectiveness

**Immediate interventions:**
