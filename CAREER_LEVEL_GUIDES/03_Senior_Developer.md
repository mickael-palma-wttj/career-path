"As a Senior Engineer, you're at an important juncture. Some people want to go deeper technically toward Staff, others toward management. I want to understand what excites you and how I can support your growth."

**Key questions to ask:**

**About their career direction:**
- Do you see yourself as an IC long-term, or interested in management?
- What aspects of your work energize you most?
- Staff level or Engineering Manager—which feels more aligned?
- What does the next level mean to you?

**About their technical interests:**
- What technical areas do you want to deepen?
- Are there new domains you want to explore?
- What kind of problems do you want to solve?
- Where do you want to be a recognized expert?

**About their impact:**
- How do you want to influence the organization?
- What frustrates you that you'd like to change?
- What kind of legacy do you want to leave?

**About their development:**
- What skills do you want to build?

- Discuss organizational dynamics
- Career sponsorship opportunities

**Quarterly themes:**

**Q1: Strategic Alignment**
"Let's talk about how your work aligns with our team and company strategy. Where do you want to focus your impact this year?"

**Q2: Skills & Influence**
"What skills are you developing? How is your influence growing? Who are you building relationships with?"

**Q3: Impact Assessment**
"Let's review the impact you've had. What's the evidence? What do you want to be known for?"

**Q4: Future Planning**
"Looking ahead, what opportunities would accelerate your growth? Are you on track toward your goals?"

---

### When They Ask: "What does it take to reach Staff?"

**Be honest: Staff is a high bar**

"Staff Engineer is a significant leap from Senior. It's not just 'more' of what you do now—it's different in kind. Let me explain what I see as the key differences..."

**Staff vs. Senior differences:**

| Dimension | Senior | Staff |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Scope** | Team or domain | Cross-team or organization |
| **Complexity** | Complex projects | Ambiguous, multi-quarter initiatives |
| **Technical Impact** | Solves hard problems | Creates leverage and multipliers |
| **Influence** | Team and adjacent teams | Across engineering organization |
| **Autonomy** | Needs direction on what | Identifies what needs doing |
| **Time Horizon** | Quarters | Years |

**"Here's where you are now and what I'd need to see:**

For Staff level over the next 18-24 months:
1. **Organizational scope:** Lead initiatives that impact 3+ teams, not just ours
2. **Technical strategy:** Drive technical direction for a significant domain
3. **Multiplier effect:** Improve how the entire org builds software
4. **Business impact:** Demonstrate measurable business outcomes from your technical decisions
5. **Sponsorship:** Build relationships with leadership who know your work

This is a multi-year journey. Not everyone reaches Staff, and that's okay—being an excellent Senior Engineer is valuable and respected."

## 🗣️ Example Conversations

### Example 1: Coaching on Technical Leadership

**Manager:** "I want to talk about your role in the database migration project. You did excellent technical work—the migration was smooth. But I noticed you executed the plan that the Staff engineer created rather than driving the technical direction yourself. As a Senior engineer, I'd like to see you leading the technical strategy, not just executing it. What's your take?"

**IC:** "I wasn't sure if I should. The Staff engineer was involved, so I deferred to them."

**Manager:** "I appreciate wanting to respect their expertise. Here's what I'd like to see: you should be the one proposing the approach, writing the technical spec, and getting feedback from the Staff engineer. They're there to review and advise, not to do your thinking for you. You have the experience and judgment to lead this. Does that make sense?"

**IC:** "Yes, I think I was being too cautious."

**Manager:** "For the upcoming API refactor, I want you to drive it. Write the technical proposal, present it in architecture review, incorporate feedback, and own the decision. I'll support you, but you lead. Sound good?"

---

### Example 2: Addressing Lack of Mentoring

**Manager:** "Let's talk about mentoring. One of the expectations at Senior level is actively developing other engineers. I haven't seen much focus on that from you over the past few months. What's your perspective?"

**IC:** "I've been really busy with the feature work. I help people when they ask questions."

**Manager:** "I understand you're busy, and I see you helping reactively. But Senior level requires proactive mentoring—owning someone's development, having regular check-ins, helping them grow. Reactive help is what everyone does. Mentoring is different. It's about making someone else better over time, not just answering questions."

**IC:** "I'm not sure I know how to do that effectively."

**Manager:** "That's fair, and that's something we can work on. Let's start by pairing you with Alex. I'd like you to meet with them biweekly, help them with their current project, review their code with coaching feedback, and work with them on their development goals. I'll coach you on mentoring approaches. This isn't optional—it's part of your role at Senior level. How does that sound?"

---

### Example 3: Staff Conversation

**IC:** "I've been thinking about my career. I'd like to work toward Staff level. What would it take?"

**Manager:** "I'm glad you're thinking about this. Staff Engineer is a significant step, and I want to be honest about what it requires. Let me share what I see as the gaps and the path..."

[Shows framework, discusses Staff expectations]

"Here's where you are: You're a strong Senior engineer with excellent technical skills. You lead complex projects well within our team. 

For Staff level, here's what I need to see:

**Scope:** Your impact needs to extend beyond our team. I'd like to see you leading initiatives that affect 3-4 teams across engineering.

**Technical strategy:** You execute strategy well. I need to see you creating strategy—defining the direction for a technical domain.

**Influence:** You have strong influence on our team. Staff engineers influence the entire engineering organization.

**Business impact:** Connect your technical work to measurable business outcomes more explicitly.

This is probably an 18-24 month journey if we're intentional about it. Are you up for that?"

**Remember:** Senior Engineers are your technical leaders. They should be making the team better, not just doing good individual work. Your job is to create leadership opportunities, provide coaching on influence and mentoring, and help them see the path to Staff if they want it—or help them achieve excellence at Senior if that's their goal. Both are valuable.
