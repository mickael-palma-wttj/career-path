## 🚀 Creating Growth Opportunities

### Types of Projects for Junior Developers

#### ✅ Good Projects
- **Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps**
  - Why: Teaches debugging, controlled scope
- **Small features with acceptance criteria**
  - Why: End-to-end ownership, manageable complexity
- **Test coverage improvements**
  - Why: Learns codebase, practices testing
- **Documentation updates**
  - Why: Learns domain, practices communication
- **Code refactoring (small scope)**
  - Why: Learns patterns, works with existing code

#### ⚠️ Projects to Approach Carefully
- **Ambiguous features requiring lots of design**
  - Risk: Can spin wheels, lose confidence
  - Mitigation: Provide clear design, or pair closely
- **Critical path, time-sensitive work**
  - Risk: Too much pressure, limits learning
  - Mitigation: Add buffer time, have backup plan
- **Complex system changes spanning many components**
  - Risk: Can get lost, take too long
  - Mitigation: Break down very small, add senior support

#### ❌ Avoid These Projects
- Customer-facing critical bugs (alone)
- Large architectural changes
- Anything where "failure is not an option"
- Work with no technical guidance available

### Creating Stretch Opportunities

**Safe-to-fail challenges:**
- "Try implementing this feature, and we'll review the approach before you go too far"
- "Pair with [senior engineer] on this complex problem"
- "Research 3 approaches to solving [problem] and present your recommendation"

**Learning opportunities:**
- Shadow on-call rotations (observe only)
- Attend architecture review meetings
- Pair with different team members
- Present a tech topic in team meeting

---

## 🔍 Assessment & Feedback

### Evidence to Collect

**Code Quality:**
- Number of PR comments/iterations before merge
- Bug rates in production
- Test coverage percentages
- Time to complete similar tasks (should decrease)

**Collaboration:**
- Peer feedback from code reviews
- Participation in team meetings
- Response time to feedback
- Communication clarity in PRs/docs

**Growth Mindset:**
- How they respond to feedback
- Initiative in taking on new challenges
- Questions asked (quality and frequency)
- Self-awareness in retrospectives

### Feedback Examples

**✅ Good Feedback (Specific, Actionable, Kind)**

"In your PR #234, I noticed you wrote comprehensive unit tests that covered edge cases like empty arrays and null values. This is exactly the level of thoroughness we're looking for. Keep it up!"

"I've observed that you sometimes spend 2+ hours stuck on a problem before asking for help. I'd love to see you reach out after 30-45 minutes. We're all here to help, and unblocking quickly helps you learn faster."

"Your standup updates are clear and concise—you always mention what you're working on, any blockers, and what's next. This makes it easy for the team to know how to support you."

**❌ Avoid Vague Feedback**

"Good job" ← What specifically was good?  
"You need to be more senior" ← What does that mean?  
"Your code has issues" ← Which issues, where, how to improve?

### 1:1 Feedback Template

**Situation:** "In yesterday's code review for the user profile feature..."  
**Behavior:** "...you pushed back on my suggestion to extract a helper function..."  
**Impact:** "...which is great! It shows you're thinking critically about the codebase. In this case, the extraction would have improved testability, but I love that you're engaging with feedback rather than just accepting it."

- Scheduled check-ins: Brief daily touchpoints
- Pair programming: Learn problem-solving approaches
- Teach debugging: Show systematic approaches

### Challenge: Overwhelmed by Complexity
**Symptoms:** Anxiety about codebase size, paralysis when starting tasks

**Strategies:**
- Break work down: Very small, clear subtasks
- Focus scope: "Just this one function for now"
- Provide context: Explain the "why" behind decisions
- Pair frequently: Learn navigation together
- Celebrate progress: Acknowledge each step forward

### Challenge: Too Timid in Collaboration
**Symptoms:** Not speaking in meetings, not reviewing code, not asking questions

**Strategies:**
- Direct invitation: "I'd love to hear your thoughts on X"
- Safe spaces: 1:1 conversations to practice
- Explicit permission: "Your opinion is valuable, even as a junior"
- Model vulnerability: Share your own learning moments
- Positive reinforcement: Thank them when they do speak up

### Challenge: Moving Too Fast, Sacrificing Quality
**Symptoms:** Buggy code, skipping tests, not reading docs

**Strategies:**
- Slow down: "Quality over speed right now"
- Explain why: Connect quality to business impact
- Checklist: Pre-PR submission checklist
- Examples: Show what "good" looks like
- Patience: "Fast comes with practice and familiarity"
