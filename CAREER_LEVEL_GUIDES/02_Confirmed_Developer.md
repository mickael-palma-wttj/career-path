**Your response:**

"Great question. Let me show you the specific differences between Confirmed and Senior level..."

**[Pull up framework, walk through it together]**

"Here's where you are strong: [specific examples]

Here are the areas to develop: [specific gaps]

Senior Developers differ in these key ways:
1. **Scope:** They handle cross-team projects, you're mostly working within our team
2. **Technical Leadership:** They drive technical decisions, you're participating but not leading yet
3. **Mentoring:** They develop other engineers, you're starting to help but not yet owning someone's growth
4. **Proactivity:** They identify and solve problems before being asked

Over the next 12-18 months, here's what I'd love to see:
- [Specific, measurable goals in each area]

And here's how I can support you:
- [Opportunities, resources, mentoring]

Does this align with what you want to work toward?"

## 📚 Resources & Examples

### Sample Technical Specs They Might Write

**For a Confirmed Developer, good technical specs include:**
- Clear problem statement
- Proposed solution with alternatives considered
- API contracts or data models
- Edge cases and error handling
- Testing strategy
- Rollout plan

**What to coach on:**
- Deeper analysis of trade-offs
- Consider more edge cases
- Think about monitoring and observability
- Plan for failure scenarios

---

### Sample Projects at Confirmed Level

**Well-scoped projects:**
- Implement user profile editing feature (medium complexity)
- Refactor legacy authentication module with tests
- Build internal admin dashboard
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Integrate third-party API (e.g., payment processor)

**Too small (Junior-level):**
- Fix individual bugs
- Update UI text
- Add a simple form field

**Too large (Senior-level):**
- Design entire microservice architecture
- Lead multi-quarter cross-team initiative
- Migrate entire system to new technology

---

### Effective Code Review Feedback from Confirmed Developer

**Good example:**
```
Looking at the error handling here, I'm concerned about the case where 
the API returns a 500. Right now we'd show a generic error, but the user 
won't know if they should retry or contact support. Could we differentiate 
between server errors and validation errors?

Also, we might want to add logging for this failure case to help debugging. 
What do you think?
```

**Why it's good:**
- Specific concern identified
- Explains the impact
- Suggests a solution
- Asks question (collaborative tone)
- Considers user experience and debugging

---

## 🗣️ Example Conversations

### Example 1: Addressing Communication Gap

**Manager:** "I want to talk about communication. Over the past month, I've noticed the payment integration project has been delayed twice, but I only learned about the delays when I asked for status. Can you help me understand what happened?"

**IC:** "Yeah, I ran into issues with the API docs being wrong. I was trying to figure it out myself."

**Manager:** "I appreciate that you tried to solve it yourself—that's good initiative. However, when you know a deadline is at risk, I need to know immediately so we can adjust plans or get you help. This delayed stakeholders making decisions. Going forward, if you know you'll miss a timeline, flag it as soon as possible. Would that be possible?"

**IC:** "Yes, that makes sense. I wasn't sure if I should bother you."

**Manager:** "Please do bother me with things like this. It's not a bother—it's critical information. I'd rather know early when something's off track. Deal?"

---

### Example 2: Coaching Toward Senior

**IC:** "I've been at Confirmed level for almost 3 years. When can I expect to be promoted?"

**Manager:** "I understand wanting to progress, and I think Senior level is absolutely in your future. Let me show you where you are and what's needed to get there.

You're strong technically—your code quality is excellent and you deliver reliably. Those are foundational.

For Senior level, here are the key differences:
1. **Technical scope:** Senior engineers lead complex, cross-team projects. Most of your recent work has been within our team. I'd like to see you own a project that requires coordinating with 2-3 other teams.

2. **Technical leadership:** Senior engineers make architecture decisions and lead technical discussions. You're contributing to these discussions, but I'd like to see you drive them—write proposals, lead design reviews, influence direction.

3. **Mentoring:** Senior engineers actively develop other engineers. You help people when asked, but I'd like to see you proactively mentoring someone, owning their development.

If you focus on these three areas over the next 12 months, and I see consistent evidence, I'll advocate strongly for your promotion. Does that sound like a plan?"

**IC:** "Yes, that's really helpful to know specifically what to focus on."

**Remember:** Confirmed Developers are in a critical growth phase. They're past the basics but not yet senior leaders. Your job is to expand their scope intentionally, provide clear feedback, create stretch opportunities, and help them see the path forward. Invest in them, and they'll become your future senior technical leaders—or they'll carry your investment with them and remember you as the manager who helped them grow.
