- Collaboration between manager and IC is essential

### 2. **Clarity Builds Trust**
- Be explicit about expectations at each level
- Provide regular, specific feedback
- Make evaluation criteria transparent

### 3. **Progress Over Perfection**
- No one is perfect at every criterion
- Growth is non-linear and sometimes slow
- Celebrate incremental improvements

### 4. **Evidence-Based Decisions**
- Collect concrete examples of behaviors
- Use multiple data sources (peers, stakeholders, projects)
- Document observations consistently

### 5. **Fair ≠ Equal**
- Different ICs need different support
- Tailor your approach to individual needs
- Be consistent in standards, flexible in methods

## 📊 Rating Scale

The framework uses a **0.0 to 4.0+ scale**:

|--------|---------|---------------|
| 0.0 - 1.0 | **Developing** - Learning this skill, needs guidance | Junior |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | **Competent** - Reliable execution with some support | Confirmed |
| 2.0 - 3.0 | **Proficient** - Consistent, independent performance | Senior |
| 3.0 - 3.5 | **Expert** - Deep expertise, mentors others | Staff/Senior Staff |
| 3.5 - 4.0 | **Authority** - Organization-wide impact | Principal |

**Note:** Ratings are contextual and should be interpreted within the full criterion description.

## ❓ Common Questions

**How often should I discuss career progress with ICs?**
At minimum, dedicate one 1:1 per month to career development. More frequent for those actively working on promotion.

**What if someone disagrees with their assessment?**
Use the rubrics to point to specific behaviors and examples. Collect peer feedback. Be open to hearing their perspective and adjusting if new evidence emerges.

**Can someone skip a level?**
Rarely. Each level builds essential skills for the next. Exceptions might be made for external hires with proven experience.

**How long does promotion typically take?**
Varies widely by individual, but rough guidelines:
- Junior → Confirmed: 12-24 months
- Confirmed → Senior: 2-4 years
- Senior → Staff: 3-5 years
- Staff → Senior Staff: 3-5 years
- Beyond Senior Staff: 5+ years

**What if an IC is stuck at their level?**
See the [Stuck Senior Developer case study](CASE_STUDIES/The_Stuck_Senior_Developer.md) for a comprehensive approach.

**How do I handle a "brilliant but difficult" IC?**
See the [Brilliant but Difficult case study](CASE_STUDIES/Brilliant_but_Difficult.md) for strategies.

**What if an IC asks about becoming a manager?**
See the [Management Question case study](CASE_STUDIES/The_Management_Question.md) for guidance.
