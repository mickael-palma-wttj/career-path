---

## 📊 Case Overview

**Developer:** Priya Sharma (name changed)  
**Level:** Senior Developer (Level 3)  
**Time at Level:** 3 years  
**Company Size:** ~120 engineers  
**Team:** Mobile Platform  
**Manager:** Jessica (Engineering Manager, 2.5 years managing Priya)

**The Question:**
"I'm thinking about becoming a manager. Can we talk about what that path looks like?"

---

## 🎯 Initial Situation

- Observes Jessica's work and thinks "I could do that"
- Motivated by helping people grow

---

### Jessica's Initial Reaction

**Internal Questions:**
- Is Priya serious or just exploring?
- Would Priya be a good manager?
- Do we have a management opportunity?
- How do I not lose a strong IC?
- What if they try management and hate it?

**Jessica's Approach:**
Don't immediately say yes or no—have a real conversation to understand motivations and assess fit.

---

## 💬 The Conversation

### Meeting 1: Understanding Motivations (Week 1)

**Jessica:** "Thanks for bringing this up. I'm glad you're thinking about your career. Tell me more about what's making you consider management."

**Priya:** "I've been at Senior for 3 years, and I'm not sure Staff is the right path for me. I really enjoy mentoring—it's the most rewarding part of my work. I see you helping people grow and think I'd be good at that."

**Jessica:** "What specifically appeals to you about management?"

**Priya's Reasons:**
- ✅ "I love helping people develop their skills"
- ✅ "I want to have broader impact beyond my own code"
- ✅ "I'm good at facilitating discussions and resolving conflicts"
- ✅ "I want to help shape team direction"
- 🚩 "I feel stuck at Senior and not sure how else to advance"
- 🚩 "It seems like managers have more influence and respect"

**Jessica:** "Those are interesting motivations. What do you think managers actually do day-to-day?"

**Priya:** "Well... you have 1:1s, you help people with their careers, you go to planning meetings... I guess I'm not totally sure about all of it?"

**Jessica's Observation:**
Good motivations (helping people) mixed with concerning ones (feeling stuck, wanting status). Priya doesn't fully understand what management entails.

---

**Jessica:** "Let me share what my actual days look like..."

**Jessica's Reality Check:**

**What Management Actually Is:**
- 8-10 hours of meetings per week (1:1s, planning, coordination)
- Handling performance issues (difficult conversations)
- Dealing with ambiguity and politics
- Much less coding (I code ~5 hours/week vs. 30+ when I was IC)
- Responsibility for others' work (you don't write code, you enable others to)
- Being "on" emotionally—people need you
- Firefighting and unblocking constantly
- Administrative work (reviews, planning, budget)

**What You Give Up:**
- Deep technical work and flow state
- Control over your own work
- Quick wins (management impact is slow)
- Clear success metrics (management is fuzzy)
- Technical skill development (atrophies without effort)

**Priya:** "Oh. I didn't realize you code so little. That would be hard."

**Jessica:** "Yeah, it's a real shift. The hardest part for me was giving up solving technical problems directly. Now I solve people problems."

---

**Jessica:** "Here's what I want you to do: For the next two weeks, pay attention to what actually energizes you. Is it the technical problem-solving? The people interactions? The strategy discussions? Let's talk again after you've reflected."

**Homework:**
- Shadow Jessica for 4 hours (see real management work)
- Read: "The Manager's Path" (chapters 1-3)
- Talk to 2 other managers about their experience
- Reflect on: What energizes me? What drains me?

---

### Meeting 2: Reality Check (Week 3)

**Jessica:** "How did the shadowing and conversations go?"

**Priya:** "It was eye-opening. I saw you handle a performance conversation that looked really draining. And the amount of context-switching is intense—you went from technical decision to HR discussion to roadmap planning in like 30 minutes."

**Jessica:** "Yeah, that's pretty typical. What did you think?"

**Priya:** "Honestly... it looked hard. But also interesting. The performance conversation was uncomfortable, but I could see how important it was for the person. And I liked seeing you help Tom unblock his project."

**Jessica:** "What did the other managers tell you?"

**Priya's Learnings:**
- "Sarah said the first year is really hard—learning curve is steep"
- "Mike said he misses coding and has to do side projects to scratch that itch"
- "Both said it's rewarding but totally different from IC work"
- "Sarah warned me not to do it if I'm running away from IC—do it because I'm running toward management"

---

**Jessica:** "That last point is crucial. Let's talk about your IC path. You said you feel stuck at Senior. Have we explored what Staff level could look like for you?"

**Priya:** "Not really. Staff seems like it's all architecture and I'm more product-focused."

**Jessica:** "Actually, there are multiple Staff archetypes. Some Staff engineers are deeply product-focused, working cross-functionally. That could be a fit. Would you want to explore that path before deciding on management?"

**Critical Moment:**
Is Priya considering management because she genuinely wants to manage people, or because she doesn't see another advancement path?

**Priya:** [Pause] "I think I should understand the Staff path better. But I'm still interested in management, especially long-term."

**Jessica:** "Here's what I suggest: Let's spend 3 months exploring the Staff path while also giving you some management-adjacent experience. Then you'll have better information to decide."

---

## 💡 The Development Plan

### 3-Month Exploration Plan

- Am I excited or anxious about management tasks?

**Timeline:** Every Friday for 12 weeks

---

## 📈 The Journey: 3-Month Exploration

### Month 1: Discovery

**Staff IC Path Exploration:**

Priya shadowed two Staff engineers:
- **David (Tech Lead archetype):** Deep in technical decisions, coding 60% of time
- **Lisa (Product Engineer archetype):** Cross-functional work, strategy, less coding

**Priya's Reaction:**
"I really liked Lisa's work—shaping product direction, working with PMs and designers, still technical but more strategic. That was cool. David's role felt too deep in the weeds for me."

**Priya's Insight:** "I didn't know Staff could be product-focused like Lisa. That's interesting."

---

**Management-Adjacent Work:**

**Mentoring Expansion:**
Added mentee #3 (Confirmed developer, Maria). Ran structured career conversations.

**Challenge:** Maria struggling with confidence, needed emotional support not just technical guidance.

**Priya's Reflection:**
"This was harder than I thought. Maria needed encouragement and I wasn't sure how to give it. I wanted to fix her technical problems, but that's not what she needed."

**Jessica's Coaching:**
"Management is often about helping people solve their own problems, not solving for them. It's uncomfortable."

---

### Month 2: Testing

**Staff IC Project:**
Led cross-team initiative to standardize mobile analytics.

**The Experience:**
- Technical strategy and decision-making
- Coordinating 3 teams
- Influencing without authority
- Balancing competing priorities

**Priya's Reaction:**
"This was really satisfying. I liked the strategic thinking and seeing my work affect multiple teams. The politics were annoying but manageable."

---

**Management Work:**

**Led Team Retro:**
Prepared agenda, facilitated discussion, handled conflict.

**Challenge:** Two engineers disagreed on process change. Priya had to navigate tension.

**Priya's Reflection:**
"I thought retros would be easy—they're not. Reading the room, drawing out quiet people, managing strong opinions... that was exhausting. But we made good decisions."

**Shadowed Performance Calibration:**
Observed Jessica and other managers debate performance ratings.

**Priya's Reaction:**
"This was intense. Advocating for your people while being fair across teams is really hard. And some of the decisions felt political, not just performance-based. That bothered me."

---

### Month 3: Clarity Emerging

**Week 9: Key Realization**

**Priya's Journal:**
"I had a really energizing week. I helped Lisa design the mobile strategy for our new product—that was so fun. I love thinking about 'what should we build and why.' But then I had 2 hours of 1:1s with my mentees. One was great (technical discussion), but one was emotional (mentee frustrated with career). That conversation drained me. I didn't know what to say."

**Pattern:** Strategic/product work energizes her. People problems drain her.

---

**Week 10: Difficult Conversation Practice**

**Role-play:** Priya practiced delivering feedback to underperforming engineer (Jessica played the IC).

**The Exercise:**
"Jordan, I need to talk about your recent work. The last two projects missed deadlines and the code quality wasn't up to our standards..."

**Priya's Experience:**
"I hated this. Even in role-play, I felt anxious and wanted to avoid confrontation. Jessica got defensive (intentionally) and I didn't know how to respond. I just wanted to escape."

**Jessica's Observation:**
"Priya's discomfort with conflict is real. She can learn these skills, but they don't come naturally. Management requires a LOT of difficult conversations."

---

**Week 12: Final Reflection**

**Priya and Jessica Debrief:**

**Jessica:** "You've explored both paths for 3 months. What have you learned?"

**Priya's Insights:**

**What Energized Her:**
- ✅ Strategic product thinking (Staff-level IC work)
- ✅ Cross-team collaboration
- ✅ Technical mentoring (teaching concepts)
- ✅ Influencing direction and decisions
- ✅ Seeing her work have broad impact

**What Drained Her:**
- ❌ Emotional support conversations
- ❌ Performance management / difficult conversations
- ❌ Process discussions and facilitation
- ❌ Administrative work
- ❌ Conflict resolution

**Priya:** "I think I was confusing 'wanting impact' with 'wanting to be a manager.' I do want impact, but I realize I want it through strategic IC work, not through managing people."

**Jessica:** "What about the feeling of being stuck at Senior?"

**Priya:** "I didn't know Staff could look like what Lisa does. That's the path I want—product-focused Staff engineer. I want to shape what we build, not manage the people building it."

---

## 🎯 The Decision

**Priya's Choice:** Pursue Staff IC path (product-focused archetype)

**New Development Plan:**
- Continue cross-team product-focused projects
- Develop product strategy skills
- Build relationships with Product/Design
- Lead technical product direction
- Work toward Staff promotion in 12-18 months

**Management Path:**
- Remain open to management in future (5+ years)
- "Maybe when I'm older and have more patience for people problems"
- "But right now, I want to do strategic IC work"

---

### Signals That Management Might Not Be Right

🚩 **Avoiding problems, not running toward opportunity**
"I'm stuck" rather than "I'm excited to develop people"

🚩 **Seeking status or advancement, not the work itself**
"Managers have more influence" rather than "I love people development"

🚩 **Discomfort with conflict**
Strong aversion to difficult conversations (can be learned, but it's hard)

🚩 **Energized by technical work, drained by people work**
If people interactions exhaust you, management will be brutal

🚩 **Misunderstanding what management is**
Thinking it's "telling people what to do" vs. enabling, coaching, navigating ambiguity

---

## 🔄 Alternative Outcomes

### Scenario A: Priya Decides She Wants Management

**If testing revealed genuine management interest:**

**Jessica's Next Steps:**
1. **Create management opportunity:**
   - Promote to Tech Lead role first (management-lite)
   - Manage 1-2 ICs initially
   - Keep some IC work (60% management / 40% IC)

2. **Provide training:**
   - Management fundamentals course
   - Pair with Jessica on management tasks
   - Connect with management community

3. **Set expectations:**
   - First year is learning curve
   - Performance may dip initially (new skills)
   - Reversible decision (can return to IC)

4. **Support transition:**
   - Weekly coaching with Jessica
   - Management peer group
   - Clear goals for first 90 days

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to transition

---

### Scenario B: No Management Opportunity Available

**If Priya wants management but no opening exists:**

**Jessica's Options:**

**Option 1: Create Opportunity**
- Split current team, Priya manages part
- Have Priya manage new hires
- Interim coverage when Jessica on leave

**Option 2: Prepare for Future Opportunity**
- Continue management-adjacent work
- Get on "ready for management" list
- When opportunity arises, Priya is first choice
- Timeline: 6-12 months

**Option 3: Help Priya Find Role Elsewhere**
- Internal transfer to team with opening
- External opportunity with Jessica's support
- Retain Priya as IC until opening exists

**Critical:** Don't promise management if there's no realistic path. Be honest about timeline and likelihood.

---

### Scenario C: Priya Was Wrong Fit for Management

**If testing revealed serious concerns:**

**Red flags might be:**
- Extreme discomfort with people issues
- No improvement despite coaching
- Feedback from mentees was negative
- Priya hated all management tasks

**Jessica's Approach:**
- Honest conversation: "Based on what we've seen, I'm not confident management is the right fit"
- Specific examples of concerns
- Focus energy on Staff IC path
- Keep door open for revisiting in future
- "Not right now doesn't mean not ever"

## 💬 Dialogue Examples

### Reality-Checking Management

**Jessica:** "Before we go further, let me tell you about the hardest parts of my job that people don't see."

**Jessica:** "Last week, I had to tell someone they weren't getting promoted when they expected to. They cried in my office. Then I had a meeting where two directors disagreed about our roadmap and I had to navigate their politics. Then I spent 3 hours on performance reviews—administrative work that felt like paperwork. And I coded for about 4 hours all week. That's management."

**Priya:** "That sounds... hard."

**Jessica:** "It is. The question is: does that sound hard but worthwhile, or hard and terrible? Because that's what you're signing up for."

---

### Exploring the Real Motivation

**Jessica:** "You mentioned feeling stuck at Senior. Tell me more about that."

**Priya:** "I just... I don't know what's next. I see people getting promoted to Staff but I don't know if that's my path."

**Jessica:** "What if we figured out a Staff path that excites you? Would you still want management?"

**Priya:** "I'm not sure. Maybe not?"

**Jessica:** "That's useful information. Let's make sure you're choosing management because you want it, not because you don't see another option."

---

### Supporting the Final Decision

**Jessica:** "So after 3 months of exploring, what's your sense?"

**Priya:** "I think I want the Staff IC path. The product-focused work energizes me. Management... I respect it, but it's not for me right now."

**Jessica:** "I think that's a great decision. You've tested both paths and made an informed choice. I'm excited to support your Staff journey. And management will still be an option in 5 years if you change your mind."

**Priya:** "Thanks for letting me explore. I feel confident now."

**Key Takeaway:** When an IC asks about management, don't immediately say yes or no. Create a structured exploration period where they can test management tasks and clarify their IC path. Many ICs think they want management when they actually want advancement—help them see all their options before they commit to a path that might not fit.
