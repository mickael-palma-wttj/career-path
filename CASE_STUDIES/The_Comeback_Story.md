# Case Study: The Comeback Story

**The Problem:** High performer returning from leave struggling to re-engage

---

## 📋 Background

**The IC:** Sam, Senior Developer returning from 6-month parental leave
**The Level:** Senior Developer (3.4/4.0) - was strong technical and well-respected
**The Issue:** Returning to work showing signs of struggle - disengagement, uncertainty, hesitancy

**Pre-Leave Status:**

- Strong performer, 3.4/4.0, 5 years at company
- Led architecture improvements on key system
- Mentored 2 junior developers
- Good relationships, respected by peers
- Excited about team work before leave

**Why Leave Was Needed:**

- Newborn at home
- Partner also returning to work
- Wanted involved parenting (not checking Slack)
- Company encouraged genuine leave (don't work)
- Sam committed to fully disconnect

**Return - Day 1:**

- Codebase: significant changes during 6 months
- Team: 2 people left, 2 new hires joined
- Architecture: major decisions made without Sam
- Projects: moved forward, shipped features
- Current sprint: mid-cycle, high momentum

**Sam's Emotional State (First Week Back):**

- Overwhelmed: "So much has changed"
- Uncertain: "Do I still know what I'm doing?"
- Guilty: "Did I let everyone down?"
- Tired: newborn still not sleeping through night
- Anxious: "Will I keep up?"

**What Manager Observed:**

- Sam joining meetings but not speaking
- Previously confident voice quiet
- Asked permission before contributing
- Working on simple tasks (not complex work)
- Seemed hesitant and cautious
- Energy and enthusiasm noticeably lower

**What Colleagues Said:**

- "Sam seems off"
- "Not the same energy as before"
- "Probably just adjusting"
- "Hope Sam's not regretting the leave"
- No one pushing hard (understood transition)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Return Was Hard

1. **Legitimate Changes**
   - Codebase evolved significantly
   - Architectural decisions made
   - New context to catch up on
   - Not being on Slack meant info gaps
   - Not small amount of catching up

2. **Identity Shift**
   - Sam was "the person who knew this system"
   - That confidence shaken by changes
   - Identity includes "competent engineer"
   - Returning with reduced certainty
   - Imposter syndrome trigger

3. **Life Circumstances**
   - Sleep-deprived (newborn not sleeping)
   - Mental bandwidth limited
   - Guilt about leaving family for work
   - Anxiety about keeping up
   - Physical exhaustion

4. **Unspoken Expectations**
   - Sam expected: ramp up slowly
   - Team/Company expected: come back ready
   - No explicit conversation about re-entry
   - Sam not sure what normal should be
   - Manager gave space (maybe too much)

5. **Confidence Erosion**
   - Small mistakes felt big ("I used to never make these")
   - Needed to ask questions felt weak ("I should know this")
   - Not speaking up felt safe ("Safer to be quiet")
   - Disengagement felt easier than trying
   - Momentum lost, no one pulling Sam back in

6. **Organizational Vacuum**
   - No deliberate re-entry plan
   - No mentoring structure for transition
   - No celebrating return or recognizing transition
   - Just "you're back, see you in meetings"
   - Left Sam to figure it out alone

## 💡 Manager's Approach

### Phase 1: Recognition (Week 2)

**Manager Notices:**

By end of Week 1, manager realized Sam wasn't thriving. Instead of waiting, took action.

**Manager's Realization:**

"Sam was a strong performer, came back disengaged. That's not normal. Something's happening that I need to address."

**The Conversation (Week 2):**

Manager: "Sam, welcome back. How are you doing? And I mean really?"

Sam: [hesitant] "It's... a lot"

Manager: "I can see that. I want to talk about what support you need coming back. This isn't like flipping a switch."

Sam: [relieved someone asked] "Yeah, honestly I'm feeling a bit lost. So much changed. I'm not sure I'm still as good at this."

Manager: "That's really normal. You were away, things moved. But here's what I know: you're still the same strong engineer. This transition is temporary. Let's make a plan."

---

### Phase 2: Deliberate Re-Entry Plan (Week 2-3)

**Phase 2A: Technical Catch-Up**

Manager worked with Sam:

1. **Knowledge Transfer (structured):**
   - List of major changes while Sam was gone
   - Prioritized: "What matters most for your role?"
   - Not everything, just critical context
   - Architecture changes documented specifically
   - New system designs explained

2. **Pairing Sessions:**
   - Manager paired Sam with engineer who drove changes
   - 1 hour: "Here's what we did and why"
   - Emphasis: "Your thinking would have been good too, this was our approach"
   - Sam didn't need to approve or agree, just understand
   - Reduced Sam's feeling of being left out

3. **Smaller Scope First:**
   - Didn't assign complex architecture work immediately
   - Started with well-defined features (2-3 days scope)
   - Gave Sam wins to rebuild confidence
   - "These are real, valuable work, not busy work"
   - Not: "Easy stuff while you get back" but "good fit for ramp"

**Phase 2B: Team Re-Integration**

1. **Reintroduction:**
   - New hires (2 people Sam hadn't met): formal intro
   - "This is Sam, who designed X system, will be mentoring"
   - Not "back from leave" but "brought you someone great"
   - Positioned as addition not return

2. **Welcome Back:**
   - Team lunch (not forced, organic)
   - Celebrating Sam's return (not awkward sympathy)
   - Asking about leave (showing genuine interest)
   - Normalizing: "Welcome back, we missed you"

3. **Mentoring Reconnection:**
   - 2 junior devs Sam had mentored before
   - "Let's get back to regular mentoring sessions"
   - Gave Sam back mentoring role immediately
   - Reinforced: "You're still someone people learn from"
   - Helped rebuild confidence (being valued as mentor)

**Phase 2C: Expectation Setting**

Manager had explicit conversation:

"Sam, here's what I want to say clearly: Coming back from parental leave is a transition. You won't feel 100% your first week back. That's normal and expected. Ramp takes 2-4 weeks. You will get back to full capacity. Here's what support you have: [list]. Here's what's expected: [realistic timeline]."

### Phase 3: Momentum Building (Week 3-6)

**What Manager Did:**

1. **Increased Visibility:**
   - Called on Sam in meetings (but only on topics Sam knew well)
   - "Sam, you have experience with this, what do you think?"
   - Gave Sam space to contribute confidently
   - Rebuilt voice gradually

2. **Celebrating Contributions:**
   - When Sam solved problem: "Great catch, this was exactly the kind of thinking we need"
   - Not over-praising, just acknowledging
   - Made sure contributions visible to team
   - Rebuilt reputation momentum

3. **Deliberate Challenges:**
   - Started assigning more complex work (not all at once)
   - Week 2: 2-3 day features
   - Week 3: 3-5 day feature with complexity
   - Week 4: Architecture contribution (smaller)
   - Ramped based on confidence signals

4. **Sleep/Life Accommodation:**
   - Flexible hours: come in when baby settled
   - No expectation of being "on" all day
   - Recognized: sleep deprivation is real barrier
   - "Take time when you need it, we trust you"
   - Allowed gradual adjustment to new life

5. **Continued Check-Ins:**
   - Not just 1:1 about work
   - Regular: "How are you really doing?"
   - Permission to struggle: "This is hard, and that's okay"
   - Reassurance: "You're back on track"

### Phase 4: Full Re-Engagement (Week 6+)

**Month 2 Signs:**

- Sam more engaged in meetings
- Contributing architectural ideas again
- Mentoring actively (running good sessions with juniors)
- Took on more complex feature
- Energy and enthusiasm returning
- Confidence showing again

**Manager's Continued Support:**

1. **Career Conversation:**
   - "How do you want to grow now?"
   - "What did you want to do before leave?"
   - Reminding Sam of longer-term goals
   - Showing: "You're still on growth trajectory"

2. **Mentoring Expansion:**
   - Given more mentoring responsibility
   - New junior coming next month
   - "I want you leading their onboarding"
   - Put Sam in leader role explicitly

3. **Advocacy:**
   - In skip-level with director: "Sam's doing great, transitioned well"
   - Mentioned Sam's leadership
   - Advocating for Staff Engineer track consideration
   - Made sure Sam's career didn't stall due to leave

---

### Phase 5: Normalizing Return (Ongoing)

**What Changed for Future Leaves:**

Based on Sam's experience, manager created:

1. **Return-to-Work Plan Template:**
   - Pre-leave: document changes person should know
   - Return: structured catch-up
   - Week 1: onboarding, not full work
   - Week 2-3: ramped scope
   - Ongoing: support and check-ins

2. **Team Preparation:**
   - Whoever takes leave: ensure team ready for continuity
   - Knowledge transfer documented
   - Projects planned without that person
   - Changes documented for return

3. **Manager Support:**
   - Deliberate re-entry meetings
   - Acknowledgment of transition
   - Ongoing check-ins
   - Career check-in (aren't affected by leave)

4. **Cultural Shift:**
   - Parental leave now normalized
   - Return seen as ramp, not immediate full speed
   - Support available, not weakness
   - Career trajectory not disrupted by time away

- Check in regularly: "How are you really doing?"
- Acknowledge transition (it's real, it's normal)
- Offer support without judgment

**Response to Disengagement:**

**Lesson:** Returning from leave isn't automatic. High performers can struggle with re-entry even when they're happy about time away. Deliberate manager support during transition makes the difference between a person who comes back at full capacity and one who quietly struggles. Small investments in structured catch-up and confidence rebuilding pay off in retention, performance, and team morale. Parental leave should not be a career penalty—it's a normal life event that great teams support.
