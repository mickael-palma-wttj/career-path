# Case Study: The Burnout Risk

**The Problem:** High performer heading toward collapse

---

## 📋 Background

**The IC:** Casey, a Senior Developer with 3 years at the company
**The Level:** Senior Developer (3.2/4.0) - genuinely strong
**The Issue:** Classic burnout trajectory - overwork, stress, beginning to show warning signs

**Specific Behaviors - Month 1:**
- Working 50-60 hour weeks consistently
- Shipping features faster than anyone on team
- Taking on extra projects ("someone has to")
- Staying late to help others ("I don't want to let them down")
- Skipping lunch, eating at desk
- Becoming irritable in meetings ("why is this so slow?")
- Code review comments getting sharp
- Started having trouble sleeping ("too much in my head")

**Team Perception:**
- "Casey is amazing, always delivers"
- "Casey got us out of this crisis"
- "Casey is the most reliable person"
- No one realizes Casey is drowning

**Project Context:**
- Team is chronically understaffed (2 people short for 8-month period)
- Company has hiring freeze
- Product demands high
- Casey essentially doing work of 1.5 people
- No one told Casey to stop or slow down

**Manager's Situation:**
- Manager is also stressed and overwhelmed
- Grateful for Casey's reliability
- Hasn't checked in deeply in months
- Realizes in hindsight: "I should have seen this"

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Why This Happened:**

1. **The Trap of Reliability**
   - Casey became "the reliable one"
   - Once you have that reputation, requests pile up
   - Saying no feels like letting people down
   - Casey's identity tied to being competent/helpful

2. **Systemic Problems**
   - Staffing shortage real but not solved
   - Company culture: work hard to solve problems
   - No protective mechanisms against overwork
   - Manager too busy to monitor workload

3. **Casey's Personality**
   - Perfectionist: doesn't hand off half-done work
   - Conscientious: feels responsible for team outcomes
   - Introverted: doesn't complain or ask for help
   - High standards: sees slack in others' work, takes it on

4. **Gradual Escalation**
   - Month 1: "helping out" on crisis
   - Month 2: became normal pace
   - Month 3: adding more projects
   - Month 4-5: no one questioning it
   - Month 6: Casey starting to show cracks

5. **No Circuit Breaker**
   - Manager should have intervened at month 2-3
   - Peers should have noticed
   - Company should have adjusted timeline or scope
   - None of that happened

## 💡 Manager's Approach

### Phase 1: The Wake-Up Call (Week 1)

**What Triggered It:**

Casey sent email at 11 PM on a Sunday: "Working on the new feature, will have it done by morning"

Manager was horrified. Looked back at calendar and realized:
- Casey hasn't taken a day off in 6 weeks
- Working weekends for past month
- Recent Slack messages show deteriorating tone
- Code quality starting to slip (still high, but not Casey's usual)
- Casey missed 1:1 last week ("too busy")

**Manager's Setup:**

Called Casey, asked to talk in-person (not email/Slack)

"Casey, I need to say something important. I just realized I've let something happen that I shouldn't have. You're working unsustainable hours, and I didn't address it. That's on me."

**Manager Shared:**
- Looked at last 6 weeks of calendar/Slack
- "You're working 60-hour weeks"
- "You haven't taken a day off"
- "This isn't sustainable"
- "I'm concerned about your wellbeing"

**Casey's Response:**
- Initial: "I'm fine, these are just busy weeks"
- Then: "Someone has to get it done"
- Then: "Actually, I'm pretty tired" (opening up)

### Phase 2: Impact Assessment (Weeks 2-3)

**Manager and Casey Diagnosed Together:**

1. **Immediate Impact:**
   - Sleep disruption ("I can't shut off")
   - Irritability ("Everything's annoying me")
   - Cynicism ("Nothing matters anyway")
   - Reduced joy ("I used to enjoy coding; now it's just work")
   - Health neglect ("Haven't exercised in months")

2. **Workload Reality:**
   - Casey on 4 active projects (should be 1-2)
   - Covering for 2 open positions
   - "Helping out" on side requests (5+ per week)
   - Mentoring 2 junior devs
   - Code review queue never cleared

3. **What Casey Didn't Realize:**
   - Working slower when overworked (what seems like productivity is actually inefficiency)
   - Mistakes increasing (more PRs needing back-and-forth)
   - Not sustainable indefinitely (crisis burnout is visible collapse point)
   - Personal cost (health, relationships, mental health)

4. **Why Casey Didn't Speak Up:**
   - Felt responsible for team outcomes
   - Fear of being seen as "not a team player"
   - Perfectionism: couldn't hand off partially done work
   - Identity: "I'm the reliable one"

---

### Phase 3: Workload Reset (Week 3-4)

**Manager's Actions:**

1. **Scoped Down Projects:**
   - Pulled Casey off 2 projects (reassigned to others or deprioritized)
   - Kept Casey on 1-2 projects max
   - Made clear: "This is not optional"

2. **Stopped Side Requests:**
   - Manager became "gatekeeper"
   - When requests came for Casey: "Casey isn't available, here are alternatives"
   - Protected Casey's calendar

3. **Reassigned Work:**
   - Mentoring: paired junior devs, scaled back
   - Code review: distributed to team (not all to Casey)
   - "Side projects": assigned to others

4. **Set Boundaries:**
   - No Slack after 6 PM (manager enforced by not responding)
   - No weekend work (manager would call if it happened)
   - Core hours 10 AM - 4 PM (focus time protected)
   - Vacation: scheduled and non-negotiable

5. **Addressed Systemic Issue:**
   - Manager went to leadership: "We need to hire or reduce scope"
   - Hiring expedited for 2 open positions
   - Some commitments pushed to next quarter

**What Casey Had to Do:**

- Accept that projects might slip (hard for perfectionist)
- Trust others with work (hard when you like it done a certain way)
- Take time off (actually take it, not feel guilty)
- Go to sleep at reasonable hour (terrifying at first)
- Actually do vacation stuff (not check Slack)

---

### Phase 4: Recovery & Rebuilding (Weeks 4-12)

**Month 1 of Reset:**

- Casey working normal hours
- Sleeping better but still tired (takes time to recover)
- More alert, less irritable
- Work quality improving (less thrashing)
- Surprised: "Things are getting done without me"
- Eye-opening: "I was more of a bottleneck than a hero"

**Month 2-3:**

- Sleep normalized
- Energy returning
- Exercise resumed
- Perspective returning
- Acknowledges: "I was heading toward real collapse"

**Deep Conversation (Month 2):**

Manager and Casey discussed:

1. **The Pattern:**
   - "How did this happen?"
   - "What were the decision points?"
   - "When should you have spoken up?"
   - "When should I have intervened?"

2. **Casey's Patterns:**
   - Perfectionism as strength and vulnerability
   - Identity tied to reliability
   - Difficulty delegating
   - Fear of disappointing others
   - Not tracking own limits

3. **Going Forward:**
   - "What would make you feel safe speaking up?"
   - "How will we notice this pattern early?"
   - "What's your responsibility vs. manager's?"
   - Created early warning system

---

### Phase 5: Preventive Measures (Ongoing)

**New Practices Installed:**

1. **Workload Monitoring:**
   - Manager reviews Casey's project list monthly
   - Maximum 2 concurrent projects
   - No hidden work assignments
   - Peer review: "Is Casey overwhelmed?"

2. **Well-Being Check-Ins:**
   - Dedicated time in 1:1s for wellness
   - "How's your workload feeling?"
   - "When's your next day off?"
   - Non-judgmental, regular

3. **Team Load Balancing:**
   - Work distributed more fairly
   - No single person becomes bottleneck
   - New hires onboarded (positions finally filled)
   - Skills cross-trained

4. **Culture Shift (broader team):**
   - Manager modeled leaving at 6 PM
   - Celebrated sustainable pace
   - Normalized "I'm at capacity"
   - Made it team responsibility to notice overload

5. **Casey's Personal Changes:**
   - Got back to exercise routine
   - Set Slack boundaries (off at 6 PM)
   - Takes actual vacations
   - Practices saying "I'm at capacity"
   - More comfortable delegating
