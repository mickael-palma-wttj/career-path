## 📚 All Case Studies

### 1️⃣ The Management Question
**Duration:** ~15 min | **[Read: When an IC Asks About Management](./The_Management_Question.md)**

**The Challenge:** "I'm thinking about becoming a manager. Can we talk about what that path looks like?"

**Character:** Priya Sharma, Senior Developer (Level 3), 3 years at level, strong performer, good at mentoring

**The Situation:**
Priya feels restless at Senior and sees peers getting promoted to Staff (unclear path). She's attracted to management because she loves mentoring and wants broader impact. But is she genuinely called to management, or just looking for a way to advance?

**Manager's Dilemma:**
Is she serious? Would she be good at it? Do we have opportunity? How do we not lose a strong IC?

**What Happens:**
Jessica creates a 3-month exploration where Priya tests management skills, explores the Staff IC path, and reflects weekly on what energizes vs. drains her.

**The Outcome:**
Priya discovers she wants the Staff IC path. Strategic product work energizes her; people problems drain her. She chooses Staff engineer path (product-focused archetype).

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to reality-check management without discouraging people
- Distinguish between "running away from IC" vs. "running toward management"
- Create low-risk experiments to test different paths
- Identify red flags that management might not be a good fit
- Support ICs exploring career options
- Structured 3-month exploration framework with decision tree

**Best For:** Managers who have ICs asking about management; ICs considering management; anyone exploring the IC vs. management decision

**The Challenge:** High performer returning from leave showing signs of struggle and disengagement

**Character:** Sam, Senior Developer returning from 6-month parental leave, previously strong performer

**The Situation:**
Sam took genuine leave (didn't work), came back to a changed codebase, new team members, and architectural decisions made without them. Feeling overwhelmed, uncertain, guilty, tired, anxious. Manager notices Sam withdrawn, not participating, taking on simple tasks, visibly less confident.

**Manager's Dilemma:**
Sam was a strong performer. What changed? Is this normal? How do we help without making it worse?

**What Happens:**
Manager recognizes it's not just "normal adjustment." Creates deliberate re-entry plan: structured knowledge transfer, pairing sessions, confidence-building through progressive challenge, celebration of return, rebuilding identity.

**The Outcome:**
Sam regains confidence, reconnects with team, rebuilds technical knowledge, returns to high performance. Learns that transitions after leave need intentional support, not just "welcome back."

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to recognize normal transition struggles vs. larger problems
- Create deliberate re-entry plans for returning employees
- Build confidence after significant life changes
- Use pairing and mentoring strategically during transitions
- Celebrate returns and recognize transition efforts

**The Challenge:** Competent performer sabotaging themselves through self-doubt and perfectionism.

**Character:** Taylor, strong performer but discounts accomplishments, afraid of being "found out," perfectionistic

**The Situation:**
Taylor is genuinely skilled and performs well but attributes success to luck. Attributes failures to personal incompetence. Afraid of visibility and speaking up. Won't apply for stretch roles because "not ready yet." Undermines own confidence despite evidence of competence. Blocked by internal doubts rather than external barriers.

**Manager's Dilemma:**
How do I help Taylor see their actual competence? How do I build confidence without seeming condescending? How do I counter their own negative self-talk?

**What Happens:**
Manager uses evidence-based approach: reflects back actual accomplishments, has Taylor track successes, gathers feedback showing competence, challenges catastrophizing thinking, normalizes imposter feelings. Over time, builds evidence of competence that Taylor can't dismiss.

**The Outcome:**
Taylor gradually internalizes competence. Becomes willing to take on stretch assignments. Shares ideas more openly. Applies for promotion. Still has self-doubt moments but doesn't let them dictate decisions. More confident and visible.

**What You'll Learn:**

**Manager's Dilemma:**
Did we promote too early? Should we demote? How do we support Devon without making failure more likely? How do we distinguish between "normal adjustment" and "wrong level"?

**What Happens:**
Manager assesses: Is this normal adjustment curve or real mismatch? Creates intensive support plan (mentoring, skill-building, realistic expectations, graduated responsibility). Sets clear success criteria and timeline. Checks in frequently. Provides coaching and feedback. Builds confidence through small wins.

**The Outcome:**
Devon adjusts to new level with support. Makes mistakes but learns. Gradually builds competence and confidence. Becomes solid performer at new level. Grateful for intensive support and belief from manager.

**Manager's Dilemma:**
How do I find out why people are really leaving? How do I differentiate between "normal job exploration" and "likely to leave"? How do I intervene? What can I actually retain people with?

**What Happens:**
Manager proactively has conversations (not interrogations) with people. Asks genuine questions about satisfaction, growth, what would make them want to stay. Listens without defensiveness. Addresses addressable concerns (clarity, meaning, development, recognition). Lets go of people for whom conditions can't be changed.

**The Outcome:**
Some people stay because concerns are addressed. Some people leave but feel valued and supported. Team culture improves because it's honest. Manager learns what drives retention in their specific context. Proactive approach prevents surprise departures.

**What You'll Learn:**

**Manager's Dilemma:**
Is this real or perception? Am I contributing to this? What's driving these differences? How do I address systematic inequities? How do I not make it weird?

**What Happens:**
Manager actively examines patterns with data. Gets feedback from affected people. Acknowledges patterns exist and they contribute. Makes deliberate changes: transparent stretch assignments, consistent feedback criteria, deliberate visibility creation, sponsorship for underrepresented performers, ongoing learning about bias.

**The Outcome:**
Advancement rates become more equitable. Different identity groups advance at similar rates for similar performance. Culture becomes more inclusive because it's intentional. Team performance improves with more diverse leadership. People feel seen and supported.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Recognize equity and advancement gaps
- Examine own biases and contribution to patterns
- Gather data and listen to affected people
- Make deliberate changes in: opportunities, feedback, visibility, sponsorship
- Create accountability for equity in career development
- Support underrepresented performers without tokenism

## 💡 Common Themes Across All Cases

### 1. **Early Recognition**
Best managers notice patterns early, before situations become crises. Don't wait until it's too late.

### 2. **Caring Conversations**
Difficult topics require genuine care and curiosity, not judgment or agenda-pushing.

### 3. **Specific Feedback**
"You're not doing well" doesn't help. "Here's specific impact I'm observing" does.

### 4. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**
People are more likely to change when involved in diagnosing and solving their own situation.

### 5. **Creating Experiments**
Rather than "fix this," try "let's test this approach and see what happens."

### 6. **Clear Expectations**
People need to know what success looks like and how you'll measure it.

### 7. **Consistent Follow-Up**
One conversation doesn't change anything. Consistent, frequent check-ins do.

### 8. **Honesty About Constraints**
Be clear about what you can and can't control or change.

### 9. **Supporting the Path They Choose**
Even if they choose differently than you hoped, support their choice.

### 10. **Protecting Culture**
Individual situations matter, but protecting overall team culture is also crucial.
