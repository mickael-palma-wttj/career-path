# Case Study: The Equity Gap

**The Problem:** High performer discovers they're significantly underpaid

---

## 📋 Background

**The IC:** Morgan, a Senior Developer with 4 years at company
**The Level:** Senior Developer (3.3/4.0) - strong technical, good leadership
**The Issue:** Discovered they're paid 20-25% below market and 15% below peer with similar level/performance

**How Discovery Happened:**

At industry conference, Morgan ran into friend from previous company (similar role).

Friend: "What are you making now?"
Morgan: [shares number]
Friend: "Oh wow, we hired someone at that level starting at [25% higher]. And our seniors are getting [15% more]."

Morgan came home and:
- Researched salary databases
- Looked at job postings for "Senior Developer"
- Checked what peers at other companies earning
- Realized: significantly underpaid

**Specific Numbers:**

- Morgan's salary: $160,000
- Market rate for Morgan's level/experience: $195,000-$210,000
- Peers at other companies: $180,000-$200,000
- Company's own hiring (recent): brought in Senior at $175,000

**Emotional Impact:**

- Felt betrayed ("I'm worth more")
- Felt disrespected ("They don't value me")
- Angry at self ("Why didn't I negotiate better")
- Anxious about future ("Am I trapped here?")
- Started passive job hunting immediately

**Timeline to Crisis:**

- Day 1: Discovers
- Day 2-3: Researches extensively
- Day 4: Tells close friend (gets affirmation of anger)
- Day 5: Creates Indeed/LinkedIn alerts, applies to 2 jobs
- Week 2: Interview scheduled at new company
- Week 3: Considering accepting offer (15% more than current)
- Week 4: Mentions to manager they need to talk

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### How Did This Happen?

1. **Hiring Approach at Company**
   - New hires negotiated (came in at market)
   - Existing employees didn't (raised incrementally)
   - No regular market checks
   - Budget planning didn't account for inflation
   - No equity review process

2. **Morgan's Negotiation History**
   - Started at $120,000 (5 years ago, market was lower)
   - Annual raises: 3-4% ($4,000-$5,000 per year)
   - 5 years of 3-4% raises ≠ market movement
   - Never negotiated hard ("didn't want to seem ungrateful")
   - Promoted once, raise was modest (~$8,000)

3. **Manager's Blindness**
   - Manager didn't realize gap existed
   - Budget constraints meant small raises
   - Assumed annual reviews were "fair"
   - Didn't have access to real market data
   - Didn't think to audit compensation

4. **Company's Dysfunction**
   - Finance: tight control on budget
   - HR: no regular market analysis
   - Leadership: didn't prioritize retention on high performers
   - Culture: assumed good work = automatic good pay
   - Belief: "We pay competitively" (untested)

5. **Morgan's Assumptions**
   - Thought company paid market rate
   - Thought raises were keeping pace (they weren't)
   - Didn't compare to external market
   - Wasn't expecting to discover gap
   - Trusted company was fair (wrong)

## 💡 Manager's Approach

### Phase 1: The Conversation (Day 1)

**Morgan Initiated:**

Sent calendar invite: "Need to discuss compensation"

**Manager's Preparation:**

Manager realized immediately this was likely salary negotiation and:
- Got context on Morgan's performance (exceptional)
- Got context on Morgan's current salary ($160,000)
- Checked what was hired recently (found $175,000 data point)
- Realized: "Oh no, we may have a real gap"
- Went into conversation honest and ready

**The Conversation:**

Manager: "Hi Morgan, thanks for bringing this up. Before you talk, I want to say something. If you've discovered we're not paying you competitively, you're right, and that's a problem I want to fix."

Morgan: [visible relief] "Okay, so you know?"

Manager: "I don't know the specifics, but I have a sense we have a gap. I want to hear what you found."

Morgan shared: market research, comparable jobs, what peers earning, etc.

Manager: "I believe you. I've spot-checked some of this and it tracks. You deserve to be paid fairly for your work. I'm going to figure out what we can do."

**What This Accomplished:**

- Took threat out of conversation (not adversarial)
- Showed Morgan's concerns were valid
- Prevented "I'll just leave" from being only option
- Opened door to problem-solving together

---

### Phase 2: Manager Advocates Internally (Days 2-5)

**Manager's Actions:**

1. **Built the Case:**
   - Documented Morgan's contributions (concrete examples)
   - Pulled market data (salary databases, job postings, industry surveys)
   - Compared to recent hires and peers in similar roles
   - Quantified impact (Morgan leads key projects, mentors juniors, drives architecture)

2. **Socialized with Finance & HR:**
   - Presented data to finance lead: "Here's why this matters"
   - Highlighted risk: Morgan actively interviewing elsewhere (confirmed)
   - Made business case: "Cost of replacing Morgan is $200K+, cost of market adjustment is $35K"
   - Proposed: One-time adjustment to market + future planning

3. **Got Leadership Buy-In:**
   - Presented to director: "We have a retention risk with a strong performer"
   - Showed numbers: gap, market data, offer pending
   - Recommendation: Immediate adjustment to $190,000 ($30K bump)
   - Contingency: If can't do that, $185,000 minimum + commitment to review next cycle

4. **Negotiated With Finance:**
   - Finance push-back: "We don't have budget"
   - Manager counter: "We will if Morgan leaves and we hire at market"
   - Compromise: Agreed to $185,000 immediately + $5K adjustment in next fiscal year (gets to $190,000)

---

### Phase 3: The Counter-Offer (Day 6)

**Manager's Conversation with Morgan:**

Manager: "Morgan, I've looked into this and you're absolutely right. You should be paid more. Here's what we're doing."

**The Offer:**

- Immediate raise from $160,000 to $185,000 ($25,000 / 15.6% increase)
- Effective immediately (in next paycheck)
- Plus: $5,000 adjustment in 6 months (gets to $190,000)
- Plus: Commitment to review compensation annually against market
- Plus: Promotion pathway discussion (Senior → Staff, which would increase to $210,000+)

**How This Compares to Other Offer:**

- Morgan's outside offer: $184,000 (15% bump from current)
- Manager's offer: $185,000 immediate + $5K in 6 months = $190,000
- Plus: Proven team, known environment, path to Staff promotion
- Plus: Manager personally advocated and listened

**Manager's Key Points:**

"Morgan, I'm angry we let this gap happen. That's on us, not you. You were right to look outside. But I hope you'll stay because we've built something good together, and I'm committed to keeping this fair going forward."

**Morgan's Response:**

- Declined outside offer
- Accepted manager's offer
- Stayed at company
- Felt heard and valued

### Phase 4: Systemic Fix (Weeks 2-4)

**Manager Worked with HR:**

1. **Compensation Audit:**
   - Reviewed all team member compensation
   - Found 2 additional people below market
   - Implemented fixes for them too (smaller adjustments)

2. **Market Benchmarking:**
   - Established annual market review process
   - All roles benchmarked against industry data
   - Adjustments made proactively (not reactively)
   - Tied to performance (does performance support market rate?)

3. **Transparency Improvements:**
   - Published salary ranges for roles (within company)
   - Made compensation criteria clear
   - Removed mystery / perception of unfairness
   - Reduced future gaps

4. **Manager's Commitment:**
   - Monthly review: "Is Morgan's comp still competitive?"
   - Annual discussion: "What are market rates looking like?"
   - Advocacy: Ready to champion adjustments if needed

5. **Broader Culture Shift:**
   - Leadership realized retention requires fair pay
   - Increased awareness of market rates
   - Shifted from "tight budget" to "invest in retention"
   - Other managers began advocating for their teams

---

### Phase 5: Rebuilding Trust (Ongoing)

**The Challenge:**

Even with adjustment, Morgan still needed to rebuild trust in company.

**Manager's Ongoing Actions:**

1. **Transparency on Decisions:**
   - Explains raise/promotion decisions clearly
   - Shows market data when discussing compensation
   - No more mystery or perception of unfairness

2. **Proactive Communication:**
   - Brings up compensation check-ins
   - Doesn't wait for Morgan to drive conversation
   - Makes adjustments before they become crises

3. **Career Pathing:**
   - Mapped Staff Engineer path (gets to $210,000+)
   - Discussed timeline and requirements
   - Showed Morgan the way forward

4. **Respect for Outside Options:**
   - Didn't make Morgan feel trapped ("You can always explore")
   - Competed for Morgan on value (not guilt)
   - Accepted Morgan might leave someday and that's okay

## 🔄 Alternative Scenarios

### If Manager Had Defended Company Position

- Outside offer accepted
- High performer lost
- Replacement hired at market rate anyway (higher cost)

### If Company Had Fought Morgan on Numbers

- Creates adversarial dynamic
- Morgan feels disrespected and undervalued
- Even if comp eventually adjusted, trust broken
- Person leaves within year

### If Manager Had Made Small Adjustment Only

- $5,000 raise (not enough)

**Lesson:** Fair compensation is a retention and fairness issue, not a nice-to-have. High performers notice when they're underpaid. A quick, honest response with substantial adjustment and systemic fix shows respect and builds loyalty. Failing to address compensation gaps is how you lose talent to competitors.
