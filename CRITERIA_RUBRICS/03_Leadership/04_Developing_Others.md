## 🎯 Definition

**Developing Others** encompasses five interconnected capabilities:

### 1. **Identifying Potential**
Seeing capability and growth potential in people. Not just evaluating current performance, but understanding who has potential to grow, what they're capable of becoming, and where they're ready to stretch.

### 2. **Coaching & Teaching**
Providing effective coaching that helps people improve. This includes teaching technical skills, providing feedback, asking powerful questions, and creating learning opportunities. Good coaches accelerate learning.

### 3. **Career Planning & Guidance**
Helping people think strategically about their career. Understanding their aspirations, what skills they need, creating path forward, and helping them see how to get there.

### 4. **Creating Growth Opportunities**
Providing stretch projects, assignments, and challenges that develop people. Growth happens through experience with support, not in comfort zone.

### 5. **Accountability & Follow-up**
Following through on development. Checking in, providing feedback, adjusting approaches, celebrating progress. Development is ongoing, not one-time event.

- Ask: "Do they own their development?"
- Ask: "Have they surprised you by growing?"
- Ask: "Would you bet on them?"

### Effective Coaching

**Coaching Formula:**
1. **Observe** - See what's happening; understand situation
2. **Ask** - Ask questions rather than tell; help them think through
3. **Listen** - Really hear what they're saying; understand their perspective
4. **Reflect** - Mirror back what you're hearing
5. **Suggest** - Offer perspective or options
6. **Support** - Be available as they implement
7. **Check back** - See how it went; learn together

**Types of Coaching:**

- ❌ Same approach for everyone (one-size-fits-all)
- ❌ Not following up
- ❌ Coaching without understanding their perspective first

### Creating Growth Opportunities

**Stretch Assignment Approach:**
1. **Identify growth area** - What do they need to develop?
2. **Find assignment** - What project/challenge builds that?
3. **Right difficulty** - Hard enough to grow, possible to succeed
4. **Provide support** - Be available; don't set them up to fail
5. **Check in** - How are they doing? What are they learning?
6. **Reflect** - What did they learn? How did they grow?

**Types of Opportunities:**
- **New project** - Something they haven't done
- **Leadership role** - Leading part of project or person
- **Mentoring** - Teaching someone else (great development)
- **Presentation** - Sharing work publicly
- **Cross-org project** - Learning how other parts work
- **Problem-solving** - Addressing a real org problem

- ❌ No reflection; they don't internalize learning

### Career Planning

2. **Assess current state** - What are they good at? What gaps?
3. **Identify path** - What do they need to develop?
4. **Create plan** - Specific actions, learning, projects
5. **Support execution** - Coaching, opportunities, feedback
6. **Review progress** - Check in regularly; adjust as needed

- **Manager progression** - IC → Manager → Senior Manager → Director

- **Lateral** - Moving to learn new area

**Common Mistakes:**

- ❌ Assuming everyone wants to be manager
- ❌ Not having career conversations regularly
- ❌ Setting path without understanding aspirations

### Follow-up & Accountability

**How to Follow Through:**

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. **Development Is Your Highest Leverage Work**
One great developer multiplies impact through the people they develop. This is how leaders compound their impact.

### 2. **Everyone Can Develop**
Don't assume people are fixed. With right coaching and opportunities, people grow. Growth mindset matters.

### 3. **Development Takes Time**
Real development doesn't happen in one conversation. It's ongoing coaching, feedback, opportunities, reflection over time.

### 4. **Support While Stretching**
Stretch people but support them. Don't throw them in sink-or-swim. Hard but possible with support.

### 5. **Development Is Personal**
Different people develop differently. Tailor your coaching to the individual. One approach doesn't work for everyone.

### 6. **Follow Through**
Development requires ongoing follow-up. Don't just have one conversation and expect growth. Check in, provide feedback, adjust.
