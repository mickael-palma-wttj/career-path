# Hiring & Org Design

**Criterion:** Ability to evaluate talent, contribute to org structure, and build effective teams that compound in capability over time.

This evaluates both immediate hiring effectiveness (finding and attracting quality talent) and strategic thinking about how to organize teams and structure roles for long-term organizational health and capability.

## 📚 Detailed Development Guidance

### Improving Hiring Judgment

**Pattern 1: Too Impressed by Raw Intelligence**
- **Problem:** Hires people who are smart but not collaborative, can't grow with org, difficult to work with
- **Fix:** Add interview questions on collaboration: "Tell me about a time you needed help. How did you get it?" "Describe a time you disagreed with a teammate. How did you handle it?"
- **Watch For:** References that talk about independence but not teamwork

**Pattern 2: Hiring for Today, Not Tomorrow**
- **Problem:** Hire people who fit immediate need but org grows past them quickly
- **Fix:** In each hiring cycle, ask: "What will we need in 2 years?" Hire for growth path, not just today
- **Watch For:** Candidates who are curious learners, not just current experts

**Pattern 3: Homogenous Teams**
- **Problem:** Hire people similar to yourself; team lacks diverse perspectives
- **Fix:** Explicit diversity goals; diverse interview panels; expanded recruiting; examine your bias
- **Watch For:** Candidates from different backgrounds; expand your definition of "good"

### Improving Team Building

**Pattern 1: Wrong Mix**
- **Problem:** All senior engineers; or all junior; never enough balance
- **Fix:** Audit team: experience levels, skills, growth areas. Deliberately hire for balance
- **Watch For:** Intentional "mentors" and "learners"; different skill specialization

**Pattern 2: No Pipeline**
- **Problem:** Can't promote because no one is ready; team stagnates
- **Fix:** Build career ladder; create stretching projects; develop junior people intentionally
- **Watch For:** Succession plan; people progressing

**Pattern 3: Dysfunction**
- **Problem:** Team has personality conflicts; people leaving; culture bad
- **Fix:** Examine hiring decisions; did you ignore signals? Add soft skills assessment; be more rigorous on collaboration
- **Watch For:** Why did people leave? What could have been predicted?

### Improving Org Design Thinking

**Key Principle:** Structure follows strategy, not the reverse. Ask:
- What do we need to accomplish?
- What decisions need to be made?
- Who should make them?
- How do we avoid bottlenecks?
- How do we maintain culture as we scale?

**Common Org Mistakes:**
- Organizing by titles instead of work
- Making one person gatekeeper for critical decisions
- No clear authority/accountability
- Structure that doesn't match how work actually flows
- Org doesn't scale with company growth

**How to Think About It:**
- Draw your org on whiteboard
- For each team/role, ask: Is this decision-making authority clear? Is anyone bottlenecked? Is critical knowledge in one person?
- What would change if you doubled in size?

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. **Hiring is Your Multiplier**
You're only as good as the people around you. Great hiring creates a compounding advantage over time. Bad hiring creates drag you can't overcome.

### 2. **Culture is Built Through Hiring**
Every hire either strengthens or weakens your culture. Your hiring bar *is* your culture.

### 3. **Structure Enables or Prevents Good Work**
The right org structure makes good work easy; the wrong structure makes it impossible. This is strategic.

### 4. **Diversity Requires Active Work**
Homogenous teams happen by default. Diversity requires intentional process design and bias mitigation.

### 5. **Long-term Thinking Matters**
Build for the company you're going to be, not just who you are today. This means developing talent internally while bringing in fresh perspectives.

### 6. **Data + Intuition**
Good hiring combines structured evaluation (rubric, criteria, evidence) with gut feel about potential. Purely data-driven or purely intuitive both fail.

---

## 🎯 Red Flags & Warnings

- ⚠️ **Increasing** hired people despite growing team—indicates poor hiring or retention
- ⚠️ **Team composition** that doesn't match stated needs—indicates no strategic thinking
- ⚠️ **High turnover** with vague reasons—indicates culture or fit issue with hiring
- ⚠️ **Surprise failures** of people you championed—indicates over-reliance on gut, not enough rigor
- ⚠️ **Defensive about hiring decisions**—indicates not open to feedback or learning
- ⚠️ **Org structure** that hasn't been questioned or updated—indicates complacency or lack of strategic thinking

---

**Remember:** Hiring is one of the highest-leverage decisions you make as a leader. It deserves your best thinking and continuous improvement. The people you bring in shape everything that comes after.
