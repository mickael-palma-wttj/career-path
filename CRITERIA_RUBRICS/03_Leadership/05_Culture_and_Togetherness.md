# Culture & Togetherness

**Criterion:** Building psychological safety, belonging, values alignment, and positive team culture where people feel safe, connected, and empowered to do their best work.

This evaluates your ability to create an environment where people feel safe being themselves, where they feel they belong, where shared values are lived (not just stated), and where authentic connection happens. Culture is what enables great work to happen sustainably.

## 🎯 Definition

**Culture & Togetherness** encompasses five interconnected capabilities:

### 1. **Psychological Safety**
Creating an environment where people feel safe to take interpersonal risks—speaking up, asking questions, admitting mistakes, sharing ideas—without fear of embarrassment or punishment. This is what enables innovation and learning.

### 2. **Belonging**
People feel they belong in the team and organization. They're accepted for who they are, not required to hide parts of themselves. Diverse people feel welcomed and valued.

### 3. **Values Alignment**
Shared values that guide decisions and behaviors. Values are lived, not just posted on walls. People see leaders modeling values consistently.

### 4. **Connection & Cohesion**
Authentic relationships and bonds between team members. People know each other, care about each other, and work well together. Team feels like community, not just colleagues.

### 5. **Support & Mutual Care**
People support each other, celebrate wins together, help through challenges. Team has each other's back, not just hitting metrics.

## 📚 Detailed Development Guidance

### Building Psychological Safety

**What Psychological Safety Enables:**
- People speak up with ideas and concerns
- Mistakes are discussed openly; focus on learning
- People ask questions without fear
- Difficult conversations happen
- Innovation and risk-taking
- Problem-solving together
- Authentic relationships

**How to Build It:**
1. **Be vulnerable first** - Share mistakes, challenges, things you don't know
2. **Respond well to mistakes** - When someone fails, focus on learning not blame
3. **Invite input** - Explicitly ask for different perspectives
4. **Act on input** - When people speak up, listen and often change course
5. **Acknowledge limits** - Admit when you don't know; ask for help
6. **Address conflicts** - Don't let tensions fester; face them directly
7. **Be consistent** - Act the same way privately and publicly
8. **Protect the team** - Have their back to outside pressures

**Red Flags (Safety is Low):**
- ❌ People guarded; watch what they say
- ❌ Mistakes are hidden
- ❌ Questions aren't asked
- ❌ Different perspectives not shared
- ❌ People blame each other rather than learning together
- ❌ Difficult conversations avoided

### Building Belonging

**What Belonging Feels Like:**
- "I can be myself here"
- "People care about me as a person"
- "I'm accepted for who I am"
- "My different perspective is valued"
- "I belong in this team"

**How to Build It:**
1. **Know people as people** - Understand their lives, not just work
2. **Show genuine interest** - Ask about them; listen to answers
3. **Accept differences** - Celebrate different backgrounds, perspectives, ways of working
4. **Include diverse people** - Actively recruit and welcome diverse backgrounds
5. **Make space for identity** - People can bring their full selves
6. **Speak about belonging** - Make it explicitly important
7. **Model belonging** - Show you belong and help others feel like they do too

- ❌ Certain groups feel like outsiders
- ❌ People don't know each other
- ❌ Authentic connection missing
- ❌ New people struggle to integrate

### Living Values

**How Values Guide Culture:**
- Decisions made are consistent with values
- People see leaders modeling values
- Values are discussed, not just posted
- Values inform hiring, feedback, conflicts, celebrations
- Values are real, not corporate platitudes

**Process for Values:**
1. **Define together** - Team input on what matters
2. **Get specific** - What does each value look like in action?
3. **Model them** - Leaders live them first
4. **Reference them** - Use in decisions, feedback, conflicts
5. **Hire for them** - Ask interview questions about values
6. **Celebrate them** - When you see values lived, recognize it
7. **Address violations** - When someone acts against values, address it
8. **Revisit regularly** - Do values still fit? Are we living them?

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Values defined by leaders, not team
- ❌ Values are abstract, not actionable
- ❌ Leaders don't model values
- ❌ Values never referenced in decisions
- ❌ Hiring doesn't consider values
- ❌ Violations of values aren't addressed

### Building Authentic Connection

**Connection Happens Through:**
- Time together (both work and social)
- Vulnerability and authenticity
- Knowing each other as people
- Shared experiences and challenges
- Supporting each other
- Celebrating together

**How to Build It:**
1. **Create rituals** - Regular moments of connection
2. **Be authentic** - Show up as yourself, not role
3. **Listen** - Really hear people, don't just wait to talk
4. **Share stories** - Tell real stories about challenges and wins
5. **Celebrate wins** - Team wins and personal wins
6. **Support challenges** - When people struggle, team cares
7. **Create experiences** - Shared experiences build bonds
8. **Time together** - Need both work and non-work time

**Red Flags (Connection is Low):**
- ❌ People work side-by-side but don't know each other
- ❌ All interaction is task-focused
- ❌ Team events feel mandatory, not genuine
- ❌ People don't support each other
- ❌ No shared identity or belonging

### Scaling Culture

**As Team Grows:**
- Culture gets diluted; intentional maintenance needed
- New people can change culture (for better or worse)
- Need to hire for culture fit
- Need to actively integrate new people
- Culture rituals need to scale
- Need other leaders modeling culture

**How to Maintain Culture:**
- Hire for culture fit (values, collaboration, belonging)
- Onboard new people intentionally into culture
- Have culture conversations regularly
- Lead by example consistently
- Develop other leaders who model culture
- Evolve culture as needed (don't force old ways)
- Celebrate culture successes

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. **Culture Is What You Do When No One's Watching**
Culture isn't the team lunch or the values poster. It's how people behave when there's no pressure. It's built through thousands of small actions over time.

### 2. **Psychological Safety Enables Excellence**
Teams without safety play it safe. Safe teams take risks, try new things, learn faster, collaborate better. This is foundational.

### 3. **Belonging Matters**
People do their best work when they feel they belong. When they don't feel safe being themselves, they hold back. Diversity is great; belonging is essential.

### 4. **Culture Is Built, Not Inherited**
Culture doesn't happen by accident. It requires intentional effort to create, maintain, and evolve. It's one of the leader's primary responsibilities.

### 5. **Values Are Lived or They're Meaningless**
If leaders don't model values, people won't follow them. Values guide behavior and decisions or they're just words on a wall.

### 6. **Culture Scales Through People**
As you grow, you need other leaders who model and build culture. Culture doesn't scale through policy; it scales through leaders.
