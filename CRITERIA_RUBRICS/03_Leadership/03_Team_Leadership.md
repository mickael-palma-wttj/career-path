# Team Leadership

**Criterion:** Setting direction, making decisions, building team cohesion, and leading by example to create high-performing, aligned teams.

This evaluates your ability to provide vision and direction, make sound decisions that the team respects, build psychological safety and cohesion, and model the behaviors you expect from your team. Strong team leadership creates teams that know where they're going and trust the person leading them.

## 🎯 Definition

**Team Leadership** encompasses five interconnected capabilities:

### 1. **Vision & Direction**
Setting clear, compelling direction that gives the team purpose and focus. Vision explains both where the team is going and why it matters. It provides context for decisions and helps the team make tradeoffs.

### 2. **Decision-Making**
Making sound decisions that the team respects. Good leadership decisions are: timely (not delayed), well-reasoned, considerate of team input, and explainable. Leaders make decisions others would have made if they had the full picture.

### 3. **Team Cohesion**
Building psychological safety and unity. Teams need to trust each other, feel safe being vulnerable, disagree respectfully, and rally around shared purpose. Cohesion is built through consistency, fairness, and shared experience.

### 4. **Trust & Respect**
Earning the team's trust through competence, reliability, and integrity. Trust is earned through: doing what you say you'll do, having their back, being fair, admitting mistakes, and making decisions in their best interest.

### 5. **Leading by Example**
Modeling the behaviors and attitudes you expect from the team. If you want excellence, you demonstrate it. If you want accountability, you're accountable. If you want vulnerability, you're vulnerable first.

## 📚 Detailed Development Guidance

### Setting Clear Direction

**Common Mistakes:**
- **Too vague** - Vision doesn't actually guide decisions ("Do good work")
- **Too detailed** - Vision is task list, not direction ("Complete X, Y, Z")
- **Too disconnected from business** - Team doesn't understand why it matters
- **Doesn't change when needed** - Stuck to old vision even as circumstances change
- **Changes too frequently** - Team confused because direction keeps shifting

**How to Set Good Direction:**
1. **Understand context** - What's happening in business? What does org need?
2. **Think about 6-12 months** - Where do you want team to be?
3. **Make it concrete but not a task list** - "Become the reliability experts the org depends on" not "Fix these 5 bugs"
4. **Connect to why** - Why does this matter? What's the business impact?
5. **Make it memorable** - Can team remember and repeat it?
6. **Get feedback** - Does it make sense to team? Does it excite them?
7. **Review quarterly** - Is it still right? Does it need adjusting?

### Making Good Decisions

**Decision-Making Process:**
1. **Clarify the decision** - What exactly are we deciding?
2. **Get input** - Who needs to weigh in? What do they know?
3. **Consider options** - What are the tradeoffs?
4. **Decide** - Make a clear call, even with incomplete information
5. **Explain** - Why this decision? What did you consider?
6. **Implement** - Be clear on next steps
7. **Check back** - Did it work? What did we learn?

**Common Decision Mistakes:**
- ❌ Too slow - Wait for perfect information (never comes)
- ❌ Without input - Decide in vacuum without hearing team
- ❌ Without explanation - Team left wondering why
- ❌ Change without reason - Flip-flop undermines trust
- ❌ Pretend it was obvious - Acknowledge difficulty if it was hard
- ❌ No accountability - Don't learn from outcome

### Building Psychological Safety

**Psychological safety** is feeling safe to take risks, be vulnerable, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or punishment.

**How to Build It:**
1. **Be vulnerable first** - Admit when you don't know something or make a mistake
2. **Respond well to mistakes** - When someone fails, focus on learning not blame
3. **Invite input** - Ask questions; show you want to hear different perspectives
4. **Respond to input** - Don't ask for input then ignore it
5. **Address conflicts directly** - Don't let tensions fester
6. **Be consistent** - Treat people fairly; don't play favorites
7. **Protect the team** - Have their back to leadership

**How You Know You Have It:**
- Team disagrees in meetings without fear
- People admit mistakes quickly
- Questions and "I don't know" are common
- People take on stretch assignments
- Conflicts are addressed directly
- Retention is high

### Leading by Example

**What this means:**
- If you want excellence, demonstrate it
- If you want accountability, be accountable
- If you want transparency, be transparent
- If you want learning, show willingness to learn
- If you want collaboration, collaborate

**Common Failures:**
- ❌ Demand perfection but make mistakes without acknowledging
- ❌ Ask for honesty but punish bad news
- ❌ Want collaboration but make unilateral decisions
- ❌ Expect long hours but leave early yourself
- ❌ Ask for vulnerability but never show yours

### Developing Your Team Members

**Development Approach:**
1. **Understand their aspirations** - Where do they want to go?
2. **Identify gaps** - What do they need to develop?
3. **Create opportunities** - Stretch projects, mentoring, learning
4. **Provide support** - Don't just throw them in sink or swim
5. **Give feedback** - Help them see progress
6. **Celebrate growth** - Acknowledge when they level up

**Track What Works:**
- People promoted from your team?
- People who stayed and advanced?
- People who left for bigger roles (sometimes success)?
- Career trajectories of team members?

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. **Direction Matters**
Teams with clear direction perform better. Ambiguity creates stress. Clear direction creates focus. Spend time on this.

### 2. **Decisions Build Trust**
How you make decisions matters as much as what decision you make. Team trusts leaders who decide well: getting input, explaining reasoning, following through.

### 3. **Psychological Safety Enables Excellence**
Teams without safety play it safe. Safe teams take risks, try new things, admit mistakes, collaborate. This is where great work happens.

### 4. **Trust Is Foundation**
Without trust, everything else is hard. With trust, everything is possible. Build trust through consistency, fairness, follow-through, and vulnerability.

### 5. **Develop Your People**
The measure of a great leader is the people they develop. Don't just do the work; build the next generation.

### 6. **Lead by Example**
You can't ask for what you don't model. Your behavior sets the tone. If you want excellence, demonstrate it.
