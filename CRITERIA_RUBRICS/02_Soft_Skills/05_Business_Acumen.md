When you understand strategy, daily decisions become clearer. You know why certain priorities matter more than others.

### 5. **Business Thinking is Learnable**
You don't need an MBA. Business thinking is learnable skill. Start by being curious, asking questions, and learning the business context of your work.

### 6. **The Best Ideas Come from Understanding the Business**
