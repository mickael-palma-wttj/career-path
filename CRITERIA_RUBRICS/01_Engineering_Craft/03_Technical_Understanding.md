# Technical Understanding

**Criterion:** Deep knowledge of systems, technologies, frameworks, and the ability to learn and apply new technical concepts quickly. Understanding not just what works, but why it works.

Technical understanding is foundational to everything else in engineering. It's the difference between people who follow recipes and people who understand the underlying principles. Deep technical knowledge compounds over time and enables better decisions, faster learning, and more sophisticated problem-solving.

## 🎯 Definition

**Technical Understanding** encompasses five interconnected capabilities:

### 1. **Systems Knowledge**
Deep understanding of how systems work—not just surface-level but understanding architecture, components, interactions, and trade-offs. Why systems are designed the way they are.

### 2. **Fundamentals Mastery**
Strong grasp of underlying principles (algorithms, data structures, networks, databases, etc.) that apply across systems. Understanding principles, not just memorizing implementations.

### 3. **Learning Agility**
Ability to quickly understand new systems, technologies, and concepts. Fast learning that comes from strong fundamentals and good mental models.

### 4. **Problem-Solving Depth**
Ability to diagnose complex problems by understanding system behavior. Troubleshoot systematically using technical knowledge. Debug by understanding, not guessing.

### 5. **System Thinking**
Understanding how pieces fit together. Seeing connections between systems. Thinking about implications of changes. Understanding trade-offs and constraints.
