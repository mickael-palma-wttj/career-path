This section covers the 6 core technical criteria that assess engineering quality, depth, and mastery:

### Criteria

1. **[Writing Code](01_Writing_Code.md)**
   - Code quality, readability, maintainability, consistency
   - What good code looks like at each level
   - Common code smells and improvements

2. **[Testing](02_Testing.md)**
   - Test coverage, reliability, design quality
   - Moving from "tests exist" to "testing excellence"
   - Flaky tests, edge cases, design patterns

3. **[Technical Understanding](03_Technical_Understanding.md)**
   - Technical depth, breadth, learning ability
   - System knowledge and problem anticipation
   - Learning speed and knowledge retention

4. **[Software Architecture](04_Software_Architecture.md)**
   - System design, scalability, long-term thinking
   - Design decisions and trade-off thinking
   - How systems age and evolve

5. **[Security](05_Security.md)**
   - Secure coding, threat awareness, compliance
   - Threat modeling and vulnerability prevention
   - Risk and compliance thinking

6. **[Debugging and Monitoring](06_Debugging_and_Monitoring.md)**
   - Root cause analysis, observability, MTTR
   - Diagnostic capability and system visibility
   - Production incident response

## 🎯 How to Use This Section

### For Assessment
1. Review the specific criterion rubric
2. Look at the 5 levels and evidence to look for
3. Ask the assessment questions
4. Match observed behaviors to level descriptions
5. Rate accordingly (0.0-4.0)

### For Development
1. Identify current level with IC
2. Review specific gaps between current and target level
3. Use coaching strategies appropriate to their level
4. Reference related skills for cross-training
5. Set development goals with specific milestones

### For Calibration
1. Reference the rating scale (0.0-1.0, 1.0-2.0, etc.)
2. Use consistent evidence standards across team
3. Discuss edge cases with management peers
4. Align on what each level "looks like"
5. Document decisions for consistency
