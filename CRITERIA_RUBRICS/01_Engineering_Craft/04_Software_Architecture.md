## 🎓 Coaching Strategies

**Developing:** Help learn established patterns; ask "why" questions about decisions

**Competent:** Expose to architecture decisions; ask them to propose designs

**Proficient:** Have them lead architectural discussions; mentor on design

**Expert/Authority:** Support architectural leadership; involve in org-wide design

## 📝 Real Examples

**Developing:** "I'll build this module. Should I follow the pattern from X?"

**Competent:** "I designed this to be modular so we can change pieces later."

**Proficient:** "I designed this with these tradeoffs in mind. If we need to scale here, we'd need to reconsider this decision."

**Expert:** "This architecture anticipates these growth patterns. Here's how it scales. Here's what changes when we hit those boundaries."

**Authority:** "This is how we approach architecture at our scale. New teams should follow this pattern."

---

## 🎯 Development Goals

**Competent → Proficient:** "Lead design of [new system]. Document your architectural decisions."

**Proficient → Expert:** "Own architectural improvements to [key system]. Mentor team on your approach."

**Expert → Authority:** "Lead org's architectural direction. Establish architectural standards."

**Remember:** Good architecture is invisible—it lets systems grow without constant rewrites. Great architects think 3-5 years ahead.
