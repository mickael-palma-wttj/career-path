## 🎯 How to Use These Rubrics

### For Assessment
1. **Read the criterion definition** to understand what you're evaluating
2. **Review the level descriptions** and find where your IC fits best
3. **Look for evidence** in the observation section
4. **Ask assessment questions** to yourself or in conversation
5. **Rate** based on the level-by-level breakdown

### For Development Planning
1. **Identify current level** for the criterion
2. **Review what "proficient" (2.0-3.0) looks like** at your IC's current level
3. **Use coaching strategies** to build skills
4. **Provide stretch opportunities** that develop this criterion
5. **Monitor progress** through 1:1s and feedback

### For Calibration

## 🔄 Key Principles

### Contextual Judgment
- Ratings are **contextual** to the level
- A "2.0" in writing code as a Senior is different from "2.0" as a Junior
- Use the level-specific descriptions to calibrate

### Evidence-Based
- Rate based on **observed behaviors**, not intuition
- Look for multiple data points (projects, feedback, behavior)
- Document specific examples

### Developmental Orientation
- Rubrics are for **growth**, not just evaluation
- Focus on "what's next" not just "where you are"
- Use for coaching and development planning

### Holisticism
- Evaluate the **whole person**, not individual moments
- Average out good and bad days
- Consider patterns, not exceptions

## 🎓 Tips for Managers

### Getting Started
1. **Pick 1-2 criteria** you struggle assessing
2. **Read those rubrics deeply**
3. **Apply them to real ICs** on your team
4. **Adjust your mental model** based on what you find
5. **Gradually use more criteria**

### Avoiding Pitfalls
- ❌ Don't rate based on a single project or day
- ❌ Don't confuse "different" with "better/worse"
- ❌ Don't rate only based on what you see directly
- ❌ Don't skip the evidence collection step
- ✅ Do collect feedback from multiple sources
- ✅ Do look at patterns over time
- ✅ Do consider context and constraints
- ✅ Do discuss with peers for calibration

### Developing Your Rubrics
- **Customize** the language to match your org
- **Add examples** specific to your products/services
- **Refine levels** based on actual performance in your org
- **Update regularly** as your org grows and changes
