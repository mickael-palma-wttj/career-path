# Career Path Questions

Common questions about IC career progression timelines and paths.

---

## Q: How long should someone stay at each level?

**A:** There's no fixed timeline—progression is based on performance, not tenure. However, typical patterns:

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Junior → Confirmed:** 12-24 months
- **Confirmed → Senior:** 2-4 years
- **Senior → Staff:** 3-5 years
- **Staff → Senior Staff:** 3-5 years
- **Senior Staff → Principal:** 5+ years (rare)

**Key Principle:** Promote when someone has been consistently performing at the next level for 6+ months, not based on time alone.

**Red Flags:**
- Promoting after only time at level (no demonstrated next-level work)
- Very fast progression without clear evidence (possible "promoted too early")
- Very slow progression despite strong performance (retention risk)

## Q: What if an IC is stuck at their level for a long time?

**A:** First, diagnose why they're stuck:

**Common Causes:**

**1. Not Performing at Next Level:**
- Solution: Gap analysis and development plan
- Timeline: 6-12 months to demonstrate next-level work
- See: [The Stuck Senior Developer case study](../CASE_STUDIES/The_Stuck_Senior_Developer.md)

**2. Performing Well but Unclear on Path:**
- Solution: Career conversation, show what next level looks like
- Provide growth projects aligned with next level
- See: [Career Conversations Guide](../PRACTICAL_GUIDES/How_to_Have_Career_Conversations.md)

**3. No Available Higher-Level Work:**
- Solution: Create opportunities (cross-team projects, special initiatives)
- Consider team change if current team too small
- Be honest if there's no path

**4. Genuinely at the Right Level:**
- Some ICs plateau at a level—that's okay!
- Focus on keeping work interesting and challenging
- Depth over breadth

**Action Steps:**
1. Have career conversation to understand their perspective
2. Review framework together to identify gaps
3. Create development plan if they want to progress
4. Be honest about timeline and likelihood

## Q: Can someone skip levels (e.g., Confirmed → Staff)?

**A:** Extremely rare and generally not recommended.

**Why not:**
- Each level builds foundational skills for the next
- Skipping levels creates gaps
- Sets IC up for "promoted too early" failure
- Unfair to others who progressed normally

**Possible Exception:**
- External hire with extensive experience
- Exceptional circumstances (e.g., IC built entire product that became company)

**Better Approach:**
If someone is advancing very quickly:
- Accelerate timeline within normal progression (e.g., Confirmed → Senior in 18 months vs. 3 years)
- Don't skip levels

## Q: What if performance is strong but no promotion budget?

**A:** Be honest and creative:

**Immediate Actions:**

**1. Be Transparent:**
"You're performing at [next level] and I'm advocating for your promotion. However, promotion budget is limited this cycle. Here's what's happening..."

**2. Document Readiness:**
Build promotion packet now so you're first in line when budget available.

**3. Alternative Recognition:**
- Spot bonus or equity grant
- High-profile project opportunities
- Expanded scope or title (e.g., "Senior Engineer, Tech Lead")
- Public recognition

**4. Timeline Commitment:**
"You'll be promoted in [specific next cycle] if budget allows and you maintain performance."

**5. Consider Retention Risk:**
If IC is flight risk, escalate aggressively for exception budget.

**What NOT to Do:**
❌ Vague promises: "Maybe next year"  
❌ Blame IC: "You're not quite ready" (if they are)  
❌ Ignore retention risk
