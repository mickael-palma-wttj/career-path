# Succession & Transitions

Questions about managing team transitions when managers leave or teams change.

---

## Q: How do I prepare my team for my departure?

**A:** Plan transition carefully to ensure continuity of career development and team success.

**Your Situation:**

You're leaving (promotion, job change, team reorg). Your ICs have development plans, promotion goals, and relationships with you. How do you not leave them stranded?

**Transition Timeline:**

**As Soon As You Know:**

**1. Document Everything:**
- Each IC's current level, performance, trajectory
- Development plans and goals
- Promotion readiness and timeline
- Recent feedback and conversations

**Create handoff document for each IC:**
```
IC: Alex Chen
Level: Senior Developer (3 years)
Performance: Strong, consistently exceeds
Promotion Status: On track for Staff in Q2 next year
Development Focus: Multi-team leadership, stakeholder management
Recent Context: Led Project X successfully
Next Steps: Needs cross-team project
Performance Concerns: None
```

**When You Announce:**

**2. Tell Your Team First:**

"I wanted you to hear from me first: [situation]. Here's what's happening and what it means for you..."

**Address concerns:**
- "What about my promotion?" → "Here's where you stand and what I'm documenting"
- "Who will be my new manager?" → "Here's what I know"
- "Will things change?" → "Some things will, but your progress won't be forgotten"

**3. Make Commitments:**

"Before I leave, I'll:
- Complete your mid-year review / promotion packet
- Brief your new manager comprehensively
- Be available during transition
- Make sure nothing falls through cracks"

**During Transition:**

**4. Thorough Handoff to New Manager:**

Meet with new manager for each IC:
- Review handoff document
- Share context and nuances
- Explain development plans
- Flag promotion timelines
- Discuss performance concerns

**Don't sugarcoat.**

**5. Three-Way Conversation:**

You + IC + New Manager:
- Introduce them
- IC shares their goals
- You provide context
- New manager commits to continuity
- Clear ownership transfer

**Makes IC feel cared for, not abandoned.**

**6. Complete Critical Tasks:**

**Before you leave:**
- Finish any pending reviews
- Submit promotion packets in progress
- Resolve urgent performance issues

**Don't leave loose ends.**

**After You Leave:**

**7. Be Available (Briefly):**

For 2-4 weeks:
- Answer new manager's questions
- Provide context if needed
- Don't interfere with new decisions

**Then step back.** New manager needs to own relationships.

**The Conversation with Each IC:**

"I'm leaving, and I know that affects you. Here's what I want you to know:

**Your career progress:**
You're [current status]. Your goal is [their goal] by [timeline]. I've documented all of this for your new manager.

**What I'm doing to ensure continuity:**
- Comprehensive handoff of your development plan
- [Completing promotion packet / review]
- Three-way intro with new manager

**What won't change:**
- Your career trajectory—you've earned your progress
- The framework and standards

**What might change:**
- New manager will have their own style
- Some processes might shift
- You'll need to build new relationship

You've been great to work with. I'm confident you'll continue to grow."

**What Not to Do:**

❌ **Leave without documentation**
❌ **Sugarcoat problems**
❌ **Make promises you can't keep**
❌ **Ghost your team**

**The Reality:**

**Transitions are hard for ICs.** Make it as smooth as possible. Ensure their progress is documented and protected.

**Done well, they'll remember you as the manager who cared even when leaving.**

## Q: What if I inherit a team with unclear/inconsistent levels?

**A:** Assess carefully, move slowly, communicate transparently—don't create chaos.

**The Situation:**

You're new manager. You notice:
- People at same level with very different capabilities
- Some ICs seem over-leveled
- Others seem under-leveled
- No clear documentation

**What do you do?**

**Phase 1: Understand Current State (First 30-60 Days)**

**1. Learn Before Judging:**

**Don't:**
- Immediately announce "Everyone is mis-leveled"
- Promise promotions or demotions
- Make snap judgments

**Do:**
- Observe everyone's work for 1-2 months
- Review past documentation
- Understand how they got to current level
- Collect peer feedback

**2. Use the Framework:**

Assess each IC against framework:
- What level are they currently?
- What level are they performing at?
- Where's the gap?

**3. Understand the History:**

Talk to your manager, HR, or previous manager:
- "How did leveling work previously?"
- "What's the history here?"

**Phase 2: Private Conversations (Months 2-3)**

**4. One-on-Ones:**

"Walk me through how you got to [current level] and where you want to go next."

**Don't:**
- Tell them they're mis-leveled (yet)
- Make promises about changes

**Phase 3: Develop Strategy (Month 3-4)**

**5. Decide Your Approach:**

**Option 1: Grandfather Clause (Most Common)**
- Accept current levels as baseline
- Focus on growth from here
- Apply consistent standards going forward

**When to use:** Gaps aren't egregious

**Option 2: Calibration and Adjustment**
- Work with leadership to re-level selectively
- Fix obvious mismatches

**When to use:** Significant systemic issues

**6. Consult with Leadership:**

Get alignment before acting.

**Phase 4: Communicate (Month 4+)**

**7. Transparent Communication:**

"I've spent months getting to know everyone. Here's how I'm thinking about career development going forward:

- I'm using [this framework]
- For future promotions, here's the bar
- My job is to help you grow from here"

**8. Individual Conversations for Gaps:**

**If IC is below level:**

"Based on the framework, I see your current work as [actual level], and you're leveled at [higher level].

**Here's what I'm NOT doing:**
- De-leveling you
- Reducing your comp

**Here's what I AM saying:**
- To progress from here, we need to close the gap
- Let's build a development plan"

**This is hard. Be empathetic but honest.**

**What Not to Do:**

❌ **Mass re-leveling** (creates chaos)
❌ **De-leveling anyone** (almost never appropriate)
❌ **Ignoring the problem**
❌ **Making snap judgments**

**The Reality:**

**Inheriting a mis-leveled team is hard.** Most of the time, you accept current levels and focus on future growth.
