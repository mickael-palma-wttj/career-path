# Remote/Hybrid Work Considerations

Questions about managing and developing remote ICs fairly.

---

## Q: How do I assess performance for remote ICs fairly?

**A:** Remote work requires intentional practices to avoid proximity bias and ensure fair assessment.

**Key Challenges:**

**1. Visibility Bias:**
- In-office ICs may seem more productive simply because they're visible
- Remote ICs' work may be less visible despite equal or better performance
- Risk of "out of sight, out of mind"

**2. Communication Differences:**
- Written communication can mask or amplify concerns
- Less casual observation of problem-solving
- Harder to gauge energy, engagement, morale

**Solutions:**

**Focus on Outcomes Over Activity:**
- Measure deliverables and impact, not hours or presence
- Set clear success criteria for projects
- Track completion rates, quality, and stakeholder satisfaction
- Don't conflate "being online" with "being productive"

**Create Structured Visibility:**
- Regular async updates (weekly summaries, project updates)
- Scheduled demos and presentations
- Public documentation of contributions
- Ensure remote ICs present work in team meetings

**Standardize Assessment:**
- Use same evaluation criteria for all ICs regardless of location
- Collect peer feedback equally from remote and in-office colleagues
- Review artifacts (code, docs, designs) objectively
- Track metrics consistently across team

**Build Regular Connection:**
- Weekly 1:1s (video preferred for relationship building)
- Quarterly in-person time if possible
- Create informal check-in opportunities
- Join team meetings to observe collaboration

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Rating remote ICs lower without specific evidence
- Assuming remote ICs aren't working hard based on response times
- Overlooking remote IC contributions in promotion discussions
- Relying on "gut feel" instead of documented evidence

**Best Practices:**
- Document observations consistently for all ICs
- Ask remote ICs to share wins proactively
- Create demo culture where all work gets visibility
- Review your own biases regularly

## Q: How do career conversations differ for remote teams?

**A:** Remote career conversations require extra intentionality but can be just as effective.

**Challenges:**

**1. Building Rapport:**
- Harder to build trust without casual interactions
- Video fatigue can make long conversations draining
- Missing body language cues

**2. Creating Growth Visibility:**
- Remote ICs may feel invisible for promotions
- Fewer "hallway conversations" about opportunities
- Harder to connect ICs with sponsors across org

**3. Documenting Progress:**
- Need more structured tracking
- Can't rely on casual observation
- Requires deliberate follow-up

**Adaptations for Remote:**

**Before the Conversation:**
- Schedule dedicated time (60-90 min for deep career talk)
- Use video, not just phone/chat
- Send prep questions in advance
- Review their recent work and contributions

**During the Conversation:**
- Start with rapport building (5-10 min personal check-in)
- Use screen sharing to review framework together
- Take shared notes (Google Doc they can access)
- Allow pauses for thinking—silence is okay
- Check in on their energy and engagement

**Key Questions for Remote ICs:**
- "Do you feel your contributions are visible to the wider org?"
- "Are you getting enough collaboration time with the team?"
- "What opportunities would you pursue if you were in-office?"
- "How can I advocate for you more effectively?"

**Creating Growth Opportunities:**
- **Visibility:** Present at all-hands, lead initiatives, write public docs
- **Networking:** Intro calls with leaders, cross-team projects
- **Mentoring:** Pair programming, async code review, office hours
- **Learning:** Online courses, conferences, internal training

**Documentation:**
- Keep shared career development doc (updated quarterly)
- Track achievements in real-time (don't rely on memory)
- Document promotion-worthy work as it happens
- Share progress with IC regularly

**Follow-Up:**
- Send summary after conversation
- Set clear action items with owners and dates
- Monthly check-ins on progress
- Quarterly deep dives

**Best Practices:**
- Be even more explicit about expectations and progress
- Over-communicate advocacy efforts ("I mentioned your work in the staff meeting")
- Create async opportunities for visibility (writing, demos, teaching)
- Ensure remote ICs know the promotion process
