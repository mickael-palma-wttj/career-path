## Q: How do I support an IC returning from parental leave or sabbatical?

**A:** Re-onboard intentionally to prevent career setbacks and support successful transition back.

**The Challenge:**

ICs returning from extended leave face:
- **Skill rust:** Technology/practices evolved while away
- **Context loss:** Projects, team changes, organizational shifts
- **Confidence drop:** Feeling behind or less competent
- **Identity shift:** (Especially new parents) balancing new role with work
- **Visibility loss:** Missed opportunities and relationship building
- **Bias risk:** Assumptions about commitment or capability

**Your Role: Active Re-Onboarding**

**Before They Return:**

**2-4 Weeks Out:**
- Email: "Excited to have you back! Let's schedule a call to discuss your return."
- Share: Major changes, team updates, org shifts
- Ask: What they want their first week/month to look like

**1 Week Out:**
- Prepare their workspace/equipment
- Schedule 1:1s for first week
- Identify a ramp-up project
- Brief team on their return

**First Week Back:**

**Day 1:**
- Welcome back conversation (30-60 min)
- Understand their capacity and constraints
- Discuss any schedule/flexibility needs
- Tour what's changed

**Week 1 Focus:**
- Rebuilding context, not productivity
- Meetings to reconnect with team and stakeholders
- Reading/learning time (docs, code, decisions made)
- No pressure for immediate deliverables

**First Month:**

**Ramp-Up Project:**
- Meaningful but not critical-path
- Allows learning current systems
- Success builds confidence
- Scoped for their returning capacity

**Regular Check-Ins:**
- More frequent 1:1s (weekly vs. bi-weekly)
- "How's the transition going?"
- "What support do you need?"
- "What feels different or challenging?"

**Flex on Expectations:**
- May need adjusted schedule (especially new parents)
- May take 2-3 months to fully ramp
- Be patient with learning curve

**Career Continuity:**

**Protect Their Trajectory:**
- Extended leave shouldn't reset their progress
- If they were on promotion path before, continue it
- Don't penalize time away in performance reviews

**Example:**
"Before your leave, you were 6 months into Staff-level work. Let's pick that up where you left off once you're ramped back up. I expect 2-3 months to get back to speed, then we'll continue building your promotion case."

**Address Bias:**
- Don't assume reduced commitment
- Don't sideline them from high-profile work
- Don't overlook them for promotion
- Challenge stereotypes ("new parents can't handle this")

**Common Scenarios:**

**Reduced Hours/Flexibility:**
IC: "I need to leave at 5 PM for daycare pickup."

Manager: "Let's make that work. What meetings do we need to move? How can we structure your work for this schedule?"

Then advocate: Don't let schedule flexibility hurt their career.

**Confidence Issues:**
IC: "Everyone seems so far ahead. I feel like I'm starting over."

Manager: "It's normal to feel that way. You haven't lost your skills—you just need to rebuild context. Give it 2-3 months. Let's check in on this feeling then."

**Work-Life Integration:**
IC (new parent): "I'm struggling to balance everything. I don't know if I can keep pursuing promotion."

Manager: "Let's talk through what promotion requires vs. what you're assuming. You might be able to do both with the right support. But if you want to pause career advancement for now, that's completely valid too. You can always come back to it."

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

❌ **No communication before return** (they show up to chaos)
❌ **Expecting immediate full productivity** ("You're back, get caught up fast")
❌ **Sidelining them from important work** (assuming they can't handle it)
❌ **Penalizing time away** (lower ratings, skipping them for promotion)
❌ **Ignoring new constraints** (inflexible about schedule needs)

**Long-Term Support:**

**Ongoing:**
- Regular career conversations (don't assume they're on pause)
- Intentional inclusion in growth opportunities
- Monitor for burnout or overwhelm
- Celebrate their contributions and progress

**Reality Check:**

Some ICs will return with new priorities and constraints. Some will step back from aggressive career advancement. **That's okay and should be supported.**

But don't assume—let them tell you what they want.

## Q: What if an IC has performance issues due to personal circumstances?

**A:** Balance empathy with maintaining standards—support the person while addressing the performance.

**The Situation:**

IC's performance drops due to:
- Health issues (mental or physical)
- Family crisis (sick relative, divorce, loss)
- Financial stress
- Personal struggles (depression, anxiety, burnout)

**The Tension:**

- **As a manager:** You care about the person and want to help
- **As a business leader:** You need the work done and standards maintained
- **The balance:** Support the person AND address the performance

**Your Approach:**

**1. Lead with Humanity:**

When you notice performance issues:

"I've noticed [specific observation]. Is everything okay? I want to make sure you're getting the support you need."

**Don't:**
- Ignore it and hope it resolves
- Jump immediately to performance improvement plan
- Make assumptions about what's going on

**Do:**
- Express concern
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen without judgment
- Offer support

**2. Understand the Situation:**

IC might share or might not. That's their choice.

**If They Share:**
"Thank you for trusting me with that. I want to support you through this. Let's talk about what that could look like."

**If They Don't:**
"I understand if you'd rather not discuss personal details. That's completely okay. What I need is for us to address the performance issues. Can we work together on that?"

**3. Determine Reasonable Accommodations:**

**Temporary Support:**
- Reduced workload for defined period
- Schedule flexibility
- Remote work options
- Project reassignment (lower stress/pressure)
- Extended deadlines
- Pause on stretch goals/promotion path

**Example:**
"For the next 4 weeks, let's reduce your project load by 50%. We'll focus on [core responsibilities]. We'll check in weekly and reassess at the end of the month. Does that help?"

**Involve HR/Benefits:**
- Employee Assistance Program (EAP) - counseling, resources
- Medical leave (FMLA or equivalent)
- Disability accommodations
- Flexible work arrangements

"I'm not an expert on all the options available. Let me connect you with HR to see what benefits and programs might help."

**4. Set Clear Expectations:**

Be explicit about:
- What accommodations you're providing
- How long they last
- What performance needs to look like
- When you'll reassess

"Here's what I can do: [accommodations]. Here's what I still need from you: [adjusted expectations]. Let's check back in [timeframe] and see how things are going."

**5. Monitor and Adjust:**

**Check in regularly:**
- How are they doing personally?
- Is the accommodation working?
- Is performance improving?
- What else do they need?

**Be prepared to adjust:**
- Extend accommodations if needed
- Add more support
- Escalate if situation worsens

**When to Hold the Line:**

**Accommodations have limits:**
- Can't be indefinite without improvement
- Can't compromise team or business critically
- Can't create unfairness to rest of team

**If Performance Doesn't Improve:**

After reasonable accommodation period:

"I've given you [time/accommodations] to work through [situation]. I understand it's challenging, and I want to continue supporting you. However, the performance issues are continuing to impact [team/project/business]. We need to see improvement in [specific areas] by [date], or we'll need to move to a formal performance improvement plan."

**This is hard but necessary.**

**What NOT to Do:**

❌ **Enable declining performance indefinitely** (hurts team, business, and ultimately the IC)
❌ **Make exceptions that create unfairness** (other ICs notice and resent it)
❌ **Become the IC's therapist** (you're not qualified; refer to professionals)
❌ **Share personal information without permission** (respect their privacy)
❌ **Ignore legal considerations** (consult HR on accommodations, leave, etc.)

**The Reality:**

Sometimes, the best outcome is for the IC to take leave, go part-time, or even leave the company to deal with personal issues. **That's okay.** Your job is to support them in making that decision if needed, not to hold onto them at all costs.

## Q: How do I develop ICs who are subject matter experts but don't want broader scope?

**A:** Create paths for depth, not just breadth—recognize specialized expertise as valuable.

**The Situation:**

IC is an expert in specific domain (e.g., performance optimization, security, specific technology) but:
- Doesn't want to be generalist
- Not interested in leading teams or strategies
- Wants to go deeper, not broader
- Perfectly happy at current level focused on expertise

**The Challenge:**

Most career frameworks reward breadth and leadership:
- Senior Staff/Principal often require multi-team scope
- Promotion criteria emphasize "expanding influence"
- Deep specialists can feel stuck or undervalued

**Two Paths Forward:**

**Path 1: They're Happy Where They Are**

**Some ICs want to be expert Senior Developers or Staff Engineers in their domain forever. That's valid.**

**Your Role:**
- **Affirm it:** "Being the domain expert is valuable. Not everyone needs to pursue Principal."
- **Keep work interesting:** Depth challenges (research, complex problems, mentoring)
- **Recognize expertise:** Title, compensation, visibility, consulting role
- **Prevent boredom:** Rotation through different aspects of domain, conference talks, internal training

**Career Development Looks Like:**
- Deeper mastery (not promotion)
- Thought leadership in domain
- Mentoring others in specialty
- Staying cutting-edge in field

**Path 2: They Want to Progress as Specialists**

**Progression Might Look Like:**

**Senior Developer (Domain Expert):**
- Deep expertise in specialty
- Solves complex problems in domain
- Mentors others in area

**Staff Developer (Subject Matter Expert):**
- Recognized authority in domain across teams
- Sets standards and practices in specialty
- Consulted on hard problems company-wide
- Depth > breadth

**Senior Staff/Principal (Technical Fellow):**
- Industry-recognized expert
- Defines state-of-the-art in domain
- External thought leadership (talks, writing, standards bodies)
- Company's "go-to" for domain decisions

**How to Support Them:**

**1. Define Their Path:**
Work with them to map what "Senior Staff security expert" looks like.

**2. Create Growth Opportunities:**
- **Research projects:** Deep investigations in their domain
- **Tool building:** Create capabilities others use
- **Standards setting:** Define how company does [domain]
- **External engagement:** Speaking, writing, open source
- **Mentorship:** Teaching others, building domain community

**3. Provide Recognition:**
- **Title:** "Principal Security Engineer" vs. just "Principal Engineer"
- **Visibility:** Present to leadership, represent company externally
- **Consulting role:** Other teams seek their input
- **Authority:** Final say on domain decisions

**4. Compensate Fairly:**
Deep experts should be compensated like broad leaders at same level.
