# Cross-Team & Organizational

Questions about managing IC movement and calibrating standards across the organization.

---

## Q: What if an IC wants to transfer to another team to grow?

**A:** Support transfers when they serve the IC's growth—don't block them out of self-interest.

**Why ICs Want to Transfer:**

**Good Reasons:**
- Need different technical challenges to reach next level
- Current team too small for next-level scope
- Want to work on different product/domain
- Need specific skills only available on other team
- Personality fit issues with current team
- Geographic or schedule flexibility

**Red Flags:**
- Running away from performance issues
- Conflicts they haven't tried to resolve
- Grass-is-greener syndrome (serial transferring)
- Trying to circumvent level/comp constraints

**Your Role as Current Manager:**

**1. Understand the Why:**
"Tell me more about what you're looking for in a transfer. What would be different on the new team?"

**Dig deeper:**
- Is it growth, environment, people, or work?
- Have they tried to get what they need on current team?
- Is there anything that would make them want to stay?

**2. Assess If It Makes Sense:**

**Support Transfer If:**
- IC has legitimate growth reasons
- Other team better suited for their goals
- You can't provide what they need
- They've been good performer and contributor
- Timing works for both teams

**Pump the Brakes If:**
- Performance issues they're not addressing
- Haven't tried to solve problems here first
- Unclear about what they want
- Burning bridges on current team
- Multiple attempted transfers in short time

**3. Have Honest Conversation:**

**If Supporting:**
"I think this could be a great move for you. Here's how we'll make it happen:
- I'll connect you with [other manager]
- We'll work out a transition timeline
- I'll provide honest reference about your work
- Let's do a good handoff so you leave on great terms"

**If Hesitant:**
"I want to support your growth, but I'm concerned about [X]. Can we talk through that first? If we can't solve it here, I'll support the transfer. But I want to make sure you're moving toward something, not just away from something."

**If Opposing (Rare):**
"I need you on this team for [specific reason] until [specific date/milestone]. After that, I'll support your transfer. Here's what we need to complete together first..."

**Only block if there's legitimate business reason, not just inconvenience.**

**4. Facilitate the Process:**

**Connect Them:**
- Intro to other manager
- Share context on their strengths
- Provide honest assessment (don't dump problems on another team)

**Plan Transition:**
- Clear handoff timeline (typically 2-4 weeks)
- Knowledge transfer documentation
- Proper sendoff/celebration

**Set Them Up for Success:**
- Share insights on what they'll need for new team
- Offer to be resource even after transfer
- Leave door open if it doesn't work out

**What Not to Do:**

❌ **Block transfers out of selfishness**
- "I need you, you can't leave" (without legitimate reason)
- Making them feel guilty for wanting to grow
- Dragging out timeline indefinitely

❌ **Bad-mouth them to receiving team**
- Sharing problems that don't transfer
- Inflating concerns to sabotage move
- "Just wait until you see how difficult they are"

❌ **Burn bridges**
- Making their last weeks miserable
- Withholding support or information
- Excluding them from team activities

**The Reality:**

**Good managers lose people to other teams.** If you're helping ICs grow, some will outgrow your team. That's success, not failure.

**Your Reputation:**
- Support transfers → Known as developer of talent, attract more people
- Block transfers → Known as controlling, harder to recruit

## Q: How do I calibrate levels across teams/departments?

**A:** Regular calibration is essential to maintain fair, consistent standards across the organization.

**The Problem:**

Without calibration:
- **Grade inflation:** Some teams promote too easily
- **Grade deflation:** Other teams have impossibly high bars
- **Inconsistency:** Same performance rated differently across teams
- **Unfairness:** ICs doing similar work at different levels
- **Mistrust:** System loses credibility

**Calibration Approaches:**

**1. Calibration Sessions (Quarterly or Annual):**

**Format:**
- Group of managers (5-10) meet for 2-3 hours
- Each presents ICs being considered for promotion
- Group discusses and challenges
- Reach consensus on who's truly ready

**Structure:**
- Manager presents: "I'm proposing Alex for Senior. Here's the evidence..."
- Evidence review: Concrete examples mapped to framework
- Questions and challenges: "How does their architecture work compare to current Seniors?"
- Consensus or defer: Approve, deny, or request more evidence

**Benefits:**
- Shared understanding of standards
- Reduces bias (group decision vs. individual)
- Learning opportunity for managers
- Builds consistency

**2. Cross-Team Peer Reviews:**

**Process:**
- ICs being considered for promotion get reviewed by managers from other teams
- Reviewers assess code, designs, documents, presentations
- Provide input on level readiness

**Benefits:**
- Objective outside perspective
- Reduces team-specific bias
- Validates or challenges manager assessment

**3. Promotion Packet Reviews:**

**Process:**
- All promotions require written packet
- Packets reviewed by promotion committee (multiple managers + senior IC)
- Committee uses same rubric across all candidates

**Benefits:**
- Consistent evaluation criteria
- Forces evidence documentation
- Creates audit trail

**4. Example-Based Calibration:**

**Process:**
- Managers share specific examples: "Here's work from current Seniors on my team"
- Group discusses: "Is this Senior-level work?"
- Build shared library of examples at each level

**Benefits:**
- Concrete, not abstract
- Educates newer managers
- Creates reference materials

**Best Practices:**

**Make It Regular:**
- Don't calibrate only when promoting
- Quarterly reviews of team levels
- Annual deep dives

**Use the Framework:**
- Always reference evaluation criteria
- Point to specific pillars and ratings
- Avoid "gut feel" discussions

**Challenge Grade Inflation:**
- "If everyone is a Senior, no one is"
- Maintain meaningful distinctions between levels
- Push back on promotions that don't meet bar

**Challenge Grade Deflation:**
- "You're holding your team to Principal standards for Staff"
- Use market and peer comparisons
- Don't artificially limit promotions

**Be Data-Driven:**
- Review distribution of levels across teams
- Flag anomalies (one team all Seniors, another all Confirmed)
- Use industry benchmarks

**Common Challenges:**

**"My team works on harder problems":**
- Maybe true, but level is about capability, not project difficulty
- Hard problems should create growth opportunities, not justify higher levels
- Focus on how IC performs relative to level expectations

**"Manager X always gets promotions approved":**
- Investigate: Are they better at developing talent or lowering the bar?
- Review their promoted ICs' performance after promotion
- Address directly if they're gaming the system

**"External hires come in at higher levels":**
- Market reality, but should be validated post-hire
- Don't let external hiring create inconsistent internal standards
- Use same framework to assess external candidates

**Manager's Role:**

**Before Calibration:**
- Understand levels deeply
- Collect evidence for your ICs
- Review promotion packets critically
- Challenge your own assumptions

**During Calibration:**
- Listen to challenges with open mind
- Advocate with evidence, not emotion
- Learn from how others assess
- Adjust your understanding based on discussion

**After Calibration:**
- Apply learnings to your team
- Update ICs on outcomes
- Adjust development plans based on new understanding
- Build better evidence for next time
