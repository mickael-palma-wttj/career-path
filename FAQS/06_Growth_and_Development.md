# Growth and Development

Questions about fostering IC growth and development opportunities.

## Q: How do I help an IC find their "next level" motivation?

**A:** Connect their work to their intrinsic motivations.

**Discovery:**
- "What energizes you about your work?"
- "What problems do you want to solve?"
- "What impact do you want to have?"
- "What skills do you want to develop?"

**Align Work to Motivation:**
- If motivated by learning → Stretch projects, new tech
- If motivated by impact → High-visibility initiatives
- If motivated by people → Mentoring, leadership
- If motivated by mastery → Deep technical challenges
- If motivated by autonomy → Ownership opportunities

**Create Purpose:**
Help them see how their work connects to bigger mission.

## Q: Should I let an IC work on what interests them, even if it's not priority?

**A:** Balance business needs with individual growth.

**Framework:**

**20% Time (If company supports):**
- IC can spend ~20% on projects that interest them
- Must still deliver on core responsibilities
- Can lead to innovation

**Align Interest with Business:**
- Best scenario: IC's interests align with business needs
- Work to find overlap when possible

**Rotation or Special Projects:**
- If IC's interests are far from current role, consider rotation
- Or special projects that serve both

**Set Boundaries:**
- Core work must be delivered
- "Interest projects" can't derail team priorities
- Clear expectations on time allocation

**Retention Consideration:**
If IC is bored and at flight risk, investing in their interests (even if not perfect alignment) may be worth it.

**IC Leadership ≠ Management:**
ICs lead through influence, expertise, and execution—not through authority over people.
