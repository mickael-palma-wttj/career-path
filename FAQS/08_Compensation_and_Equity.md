# Compensation & Equity

Questions about handling compensation discussions and pay equity issues.

## Q: How do I handle compensation discussions during career conversations?

**A:** Separate compensation from career development to keep conversations focused and productive.

**The Challenge:**

Many ICs conflate career level with compensation, leading to:
- Career conversations derailing into comp complaints
- ICs pursuing promotion primarily for salary bump
- Confusion between performance, level, and pay

**Best Practice: Separate the Discussions**

**Career Development Conversation (Monthly/Quarterly):**
- Focus on: Skills, growth, impact, next level readiness
- Discuss: Development goals, project opportunities, feedback
- Timeline: Ongoing throughout year

**Compensation Conversation (Annual or Ad-Hoc):**
- Focus on: Market rate, internal equity, performance rewards
- Discuss: Salary, bonus, equity, benefits
- Timeline: Annual cycle, promotion events, or market adjustments

**When IC Brings Up Comp in Career Conversation:**

**If It's Actually About Level:**
IC: "I feel underpaid for my work."

Manager: "Let me make sure I understand. Are you saying:
- Your compensation doesn't match market for your level? (comp issue)
- You're performing above your current level? (promotion question)
- Both?

Let's address them separately so we can be clear on both."

**If It's Purely Compensation:**
IC: "When will I get a raise?"

Manager: "Let's schedule a separate conversation specifically about compensation. For today, let's focus on your career development and what you need to grow. Sound good?"

Then schedule comp conversation within 1-2 weeks.

**If It's Legitimate Context:**
IC: "I'm thinking about leaving because of compensation. Should I even focus on career development here?"

Manager: "I appreciate you being direct. Let's address both. First, tell me about the comp situation so I understand the urgency. Then let's talk about your career path here and whether we can make this work."

**How to Run a Compensation Conversation:**

**Preparation:**
- Know their current comp (base, bonus, equity)
- Know market data for their level
- Understand internal equity (what peers make)
- Know budget constraints and timelines

**Structure:**
1. **Current state:** "Here's your current compensation..."
2. **Market context:** "Based on market data for [level]..."
3. **Internal equity:** "Compared to peers at your level..."
4. **Performance factor:** "Given your performance..."
5. **Next steps:** "Here's what I can do / Here's the timeline..."

**Be Honest About Constraints:**
- "We don't have budget for adjustments until Q3"
- "Promotion would bring you to $X, but you'd need to demonstrate Y first"
- "Market rate for your level is $X, and you're at $Y"

**When You Can't Meet Their Expectations:**
- Acknowledge the frustration
- Explain the constraints honestly
- Offer what you can (timeline, next opportunity, alternative paths)
- Be prepared for them to leave

**Red Flags:**
- Promising comp increases you can't deliver
- Using comp to avoid addressing career development issues
- Making IC feel greedy for asking about pay

## Q: What if an IC is at the right level but underpaid?

**A:** Separate level from compensation and address the pay gap directly.

**The Situation:**

IC is performing exactly at their level, but:
- Hired below market rate
- Market rates increased since hire
- Internal equity issues (newer hires paid more)
- Comp fell behind due to small annual increases

**This is NOT a promotion issue—it's a market adjustment issue.**

**Immediate Actions:**

**1. Verify the Gap:**
- Research current market rates for their level
- Check internal equity (what others at same level make)
- Quantify the gap specifically

**2. Acknowledge It:**
IC: "I found out I'm paid less than new hires at my level."

Manager: "Thank you for bringing this up. Let me look into this and get back to you within a week with specifics."

**Don't dismiss or deflect—take it seriously.**

**3. Investigate:**
- Confirm compensation data
- Understand why gap exists
- Determine if it's systemic or individual
- Check budget and approval process for adjustments

**4. Advocate:**
- Build case for market adjustment (not promotion)
- Show market data and internal comparisons
- Highlight retention risk if IC is strong performer
- Push for off-cycle adjustment if possible

**Having the Follow-Up Conversation:**

**If You Can Fix It:**
"I looked into this and you're right—you're below market for your level. I've gotten approval for an adjustment to $X, effective [date]. This brings you in line with market and internal peers at [level]. This is separate from your annual review and doesn't affect future increases."

**If You Can't Fix It Immediately:**
"I've confirmed there's a gap. Here's what I'm doing:
- Submitted request for market adjustment (decision by [date])
- Flagged for priority in next comp cycle ([timeframe])
- Documented your case with HR

I understand this is frustrating. I'm committed to fixing it, but it may take [timeline]. Are you able to wait for that, or do we need to discuss other options?"

**If You Can't Fix It:**
"I've reviewed this with leadership and unfortunately we don't have budget for adjustments right now. The earliest opportunity would be [timeline]. I completely understand if you need to explore other options. If you decide to stay, I'm committed to addressing this as soon as possible."

**Be honest. Don't string them along.**

**Long-Term Solutions:**

**Prevent Future Gaps:**
- Review comp regularly against market
- Flag ICs falling behind before they discover it
- Advocate for regular market adjustments
- Ensure new hire offers don't exceed current team rates

**Alternative Recognition:**
While working on comp adjustment:
- Spot bonus (if available)
- Additional equity grant
- High-profile projects
- Expanded scope/title
- Extra PTO or flexibility

**Important Distinctions:**

**Market Adjustment ≠ Promotion:**
- Market adjustment: Bringing pay in line with peers at same level
- Promotion: Moving to next level with corresponding pay increase

**Don't Conflate:**
- IC at right level but underpaid → Market adjustment
- IC performing at next level → Promotion (with associated pay increase)
- IC at right level but wants more money → Career development conversation about path to next level

**Red Flags:**
- Promoting someone just to give them a raise
- Telling underpaid ICs "just focus on getting promoted"
- Ignoring compensation issues until IC gets competing offer
- Making promises about comp you can't keep

**Reality Check:**

If you can't fix compensation gaps, you will lose people. Be prepared for that and be honest with leadership about retention risks.
