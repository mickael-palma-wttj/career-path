# Difficult Situations

Questions about handling challenging performance and behavioral issues.

## Q: What if an IC is consistently underperforming?

**A:** Address early and systematically.

**Stage 1: Informal Coaching (First 2-4 Weeks)**
- Clear, direct feedback: "I'm seeing concerns with [X]. This needs to improve."
- Specific examples
- Expectations and timeline
- Support and resources
- Document conversations

**Stage 2: Formal Coaching (Weeks 4-8)**
- Written feedback
- Formal improvement plan (not PIP yet)
- Weekly check-ins
- Clear consequences
- Continue documentation

**Stage 3: Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**
- Formal HR process
- 60-90 day timeline
- Specific goals and metrics
- Weekly monitoring
- Outcome: Improve or exit

**Stage 4: Termination**
- If PIP unsuccessful
- With HR support
- Severance if appropriate

**Don't:**
❌ Ignore hoping it fixes itself  
❌ Skip straight to PIP (except serious issues)  
❌ Lack documentation  
❌ Surprise them with termination

## Q: How do I handle a "brilliant but difficult" IC?

**A:** Address behavior while acknowledging technical strength.

**Process:**

**1. Direct Feedback:**
"Your technical work is excellent. However, your communication style is creating problems. Here are specific examples..."

**2. Clear Expectations:**
"High standards and respectful communication aren't mutually exclusive. Here's what needs to change..."

**3. Support:**
- Communication coaching
- Templates and examples
- Real-time feedback

**4. Accountability:**
- Monitor closely
- Address incidents immediately
- Hold to standards

**5. Consequences:**
"If behavior doesn't improve, it will affect your rating/employment, despite technical strength."

**Decision Point:**
Technical excellence doesn't excuse poor behavior. If they can't/won't change, they need to leave—team health matters more.

## Q: What if someone was promoted too early?

**A:** Support them to grow into the role.

**Acknowledge Reality:**
"Looking at your promotion and comparing to framework, I think you were promoted before you'd fully demonstrated next-level work. That's not your fault. But we need to get you performing at this level."

**Support Plan:**
- Scaffold their work (more support than typical for level)
- Right-size projects (achievable wins)
- Explicit skill development
- Gradual increase in scope
- Timeline: 6-9 months to grow into role

**Demotion as Last Resort:**
Only if they can't reach level after extended support period. Very difficult but sometimes necessary.

**Prevention:**
- Rigorous promotion standards
- Require demonstrated next-level performance
- Challenge thin promotion packets

## Q: How do I respond when a top performer says they're leaving?

**A:** Act quickly and comprehensively.

**Phase 1: Understand (Day 1)**
- Listen deeply to real issues
- Don't panic or guilt-trip
- Ask for time to respond

**Phase 2: Assess (Days 1-2)**
- What's fixable?
- Is fighting for them worth it?
- What resources can I secure?

**Phase 3: Build Response (Days 3-7)**
- Escalate for support (VP, HR)
- Build comprehensive package (comp, growth, scope, recognition)
- Get specific approvals

**Phase 4: Present (Week 2)**
- Specific, concrete offer
- Honest about what you can/can't do
- Respect their choice

**Phase 5: Follow Through**
- Deliver immediately
- Monitor satisfaction
- Sustain changes

**If They Leave Anyway:**
Support graceful exit. Maintain relationship.
