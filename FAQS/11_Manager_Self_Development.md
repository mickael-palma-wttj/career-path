# Manager Self-Development

Questions about measuring your effectiveness as a manager and handling capacity issues.

---

## Q: How do I know if I'm doing a good job developing my team?

**A:** Track both leading indicators (your actions) and lagging indicators (outcomes).

**Leading Indicators (Your Actions):**

**Are you doing the work?**
- ✅ Monthly career-focused 1:1s with each IC
- ✅ Documented development plans for all ICs
- ✅ Regular, specific feedback (not just at review time)
- ✅ Actively creating growth opportunities
- ✅ Advocating for your ICs in promotion discussions
- ✅ Collecting peer feedback regularly
- ✅ Spending at least 20-30% of your time on people development

**If you're not doing these, outcomes won't matter—you're not investing.**

**Lagging Indicators (Outcomes):**

**Team Growth:**
- Are ICs progressing at reasonable pace?
- Are you producing candidates for next level?

**Team Satisfaction:**
- Do ICs feel supported in their development?
- Do ICs understand career expectations?

**Team Retention:**
- Are you keeping your high performers?
- Why do people leave?

**Team Performance:**
- Is the team delivering consistently?
- Is capability increasing over time?

**Reputation:**
- Do other ICs want to join your team?
- Are you known as a developer of talent?

**How to Assess:**

**Self-Audit (Monthly):**
- Did I have career conversations with each IC?
- Did I provide specific feedback?
- Did I create growth opportunities?
- Did I advocate for my team?

**Quarterly Review:**
- Review each IC's development plan
- Assess progress against goals
- Identify who's advancing, who's stuck

**Ask for Feedback:**
"On a scale of 1-10, how supported do you feel in your career development? What would make it a 10?"

**Warning Signs You're Not Doing Well:**

🚨 **High attrition** (especially of top performers)
🚨 **ICs surprised at performance reviews** (poor feedback loop)
🚨 **No promotions in 2+ years**
🚨 **ICs don't understand career expectations**
🚨 **Not spending time on people development**

**Good Signs:**

✅ **ICs can articulate their development goals clearly**
✅ **Regular promotions at reasonable pace**
✅ **High performers stay and grow**
✅ **Other ICs want to join your team**

## Q: What if I have too many ICs to give adequate career attention?

**A:** This is a span of control problem—advocate for team restructuring or adjust your approach.

**The Problem:**

**Healthy Span of Control:**
- **Individual contributors:** 5-8 direct reports
- **Managers of managers:** 4-6 direct reports

**With Career Development:**
- Each IC needs 1-2 hours/month of dedicated career time
- 8 ICs = 8-16 hours/month (manageable)
- 15+ ICs = 15-30+ hours/month (unsustainable)

**If you have 12+ ICs, you cannot adequately invest in everyone's development.**

**Short-Term Solutions:**

**1. Triage Your Attention:**

**High Priority ICs (More Time):**
- Actively pursuing promotion
- Performance concerns
- New to team or level
- High potential / high impact

**Steady State ICs (Less Time):**
- Performing well at level
- Not actively seeking promotion
- Experienced and independent

**Be explicit with your team about these trade-offs.**

**2. Batch Similar Career Conversations:**
- Group ICs at same level for some discussions
- Run office hours on career topics
- Create peer development pods

**3. Leverage Senior ICs:**
- Senior ICs can mentor juniors
- Staff+ ICs can coach on career development

**Long-Term Solution: Advocate for Team Split**

**Make the Business Case:**

To Your Manager:
"I currently have 14 direct reports. Effective career development requires 1-2 hours per IC per month. That's 14-28 hours monthly—35-70% of my time.

**Impact of current span:**
- ICs not getting adequate development attention
- Promotion advocacy suffering
- Retention risk increasing

**Proposal:**
Split team into two groups of 7 with a second manager."

**What If You Can't Get Team Split?**

**Be Honest About Trade-Offs:**

To Your Team:
"With current team size, I have to make trade-offs. Here's what I can commit to:
- Quarterly career deep dives with everyone
- Monthly career check-ins with those actively pursuing promotion
- Open door for career discussions anytime"

**Warning Signs of Breaking Point:**

🚨 Skipping career conversations regularly
🚨 Don't know what each IC is working on
🚨 High performers leaving
🚨 Burning out yourself

**The Reality:**

**Span of control problems don't fix themselves.** Advocate loudly for restructuring.
