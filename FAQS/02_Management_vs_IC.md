# Management vs. IC Path

Questions about choosing between individual contributor and management tracks.

---

## Q: How do I respond when an IC asks about becoming a manager?

**A:** Don't immediately say yes or no—explore their motivations.

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "What's making you consider management?"
2. "What do you think managers actually do day-to-day?"
3. "What appeals to you about management?"
4. "What concerns do you have?"

**Red Flags (Not Ready for Management):**
- 🚩 "I feel stuck as an IC" (running away, not toward)
- 🚩 "Managers have more authority/respect" (seeking status)
- 🚩 "I could do my manager's job" (overconfidence)
- 🚩 Doesn't understand what management entails
- 🚩 Dislikes people problems or conflict

**Green Flags (Might Be Good Fit):**
- ✅ Energized by developing others
- ✅ Comfortable with ambiguity
- ✅ Willing to give up technical depth
- ✅ Patient with people issues
- ✅ Thinks strategically about teams

**Recommended Process:**
1. Reality-check what management is (share honestly)
2. Test management skills (mentoring, facilitation, difficult conversations)
3. Explore Staff IC path simultaneously
4. Give 3-6 months to explore before deciding

## Q: Can someone switch back from management to IC?

**A:** Yes, and it's becoming more common and accepted.

**Reasons for Switch:**
- Realized management isn't the right fit
- Misses technical depth
- Life circumstances changed
- Management opportunity was temporary (interim role)

**How to Support:**

**If IC Returns to Your Team:**
- Frame positively: "Taking on leadership experience and bringing it back to IC work"
- No shame or stigma
- Technical skills may need refreshing (pair programming, learning time)
- Leverage their management perspective

**Common Concerns:**
- "Will I lose face?" → Frame as growth, not failure
- "What level do I return at?" → Typically same level they left (or one below if was at management level)
- "Will my technical skills be stale?" → Yes, but can be rebuilt with support

**Timeline:** Typically 3-6 months to get back to full IC productivity.
