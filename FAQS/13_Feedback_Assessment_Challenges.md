# Feedback & Assessment Challenges

Questions about handling self-assessment discrepancies and conflicting feedback.

---

## Q: How do I handle self-assessment inflation (IC rates themselves too high)?

**A:** Use evidence-based discussion to calibrate without deflating confidence.

**The Situation:**

IC's self-assessment:
- "I'm performing at Staff level" (you see Confirmed)
- "I'm a 4.0 on Communication" (you see 2.0)
- "I'm ready for promotion" (you see significant gaps)

**Why This Happens:**

**Innocent Reasons:**
- Genuine lack of awareness (Dunning-Kruger effect)
- Different understanding of framework/level
- Limited visibility into what next level looks like

**Concerning Reasons:**
- Defensive response to feeling undervalued
- Overconfidence or inflated ego

**Your Approach:**

**1. Don't Dismiss or Mock**

❌ "That's way off"
❌ "You really think that?"

✅ "I see you've rated yourself [X]. Let's talk through how you got there and compare to my assessment."

**2. Ask About Their Reasoning**

"You've rated yourself 4.0 on Communication. Tell me what made you choose that rating. What examples are you thinking of?"

**Understand their perspective first.**

**3. Share Your Assessment with Evidence**

"Here's where I rated you and why: [specific examples]."

**Use concrete evidence:**
- ❌ "I think you're more like a 2.5"
- ✅ "In the last three projects, I've seen [specific behaviors]. Based on the framework, that maps to ~2.5."

**4. Show Framework/Level Comparison**

"Let's look at the framework together. Level 4.0 says [specific criteria]. Level 2.5 says [specific criteria]. Based on what I've observed, here's where I see you currently..."

**5. Identify the Gap Collaboratively**

"It sounds like you see yourself at 4.0 and I see 2.5. Let's figure out where the disconnect is."

**Possible gaps:**
- They're not seeing their impact accurately
- You're not seeing all their work
- Different interpretation of criteria

**6. Create Shared Understanding**

"Based on this conversation, where do you think you actually are? Where do you see the biggest gaps?"

**Goal:** Align on reality without crushing confidence.

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: They Genuinely Didn't Know**

IC: "Oh, I thought Senior meant [X]. I see now that it's actually [Y]."

Manager: "Exactly. You're doing solid Confirmed-level work. Here's what we need to focus on..."

**Scenario 2: You Missed Their Work**

IC: "I actually have been doing [X, Y, Z] that might not be visible."

Manager: "I didn't know about that. You're right, that's stronger than I realized. Let me adjust my assessment."

**Scenario 3: They're Defensive**

IC: "I don't agree with your assessment. I think you're being too harsh."

Manager: "Let's use the framework as our shared reference. Can you point to specific examples that show [higher level]?"

**When Self-Assessment is Consistently Inflated:**

"I've noticed in the last few assessments, there's been a significant gap. Let's talk about why that's happening and how we can get more aligned."

**Tips for Prevention:**

**Make Framework Visible:**
- Share rubrics openly
- Review criteria together regularly

**Give Continuous Feedback:**
- ICs shouldn't be surprised at assessment time
- Real-time calibration

**Show Peers as Examples:**
- "Alex is a strong Staff engineer. Notice how they [behavior]"

**The Balance:**

**Don't deflate confidence:**
- Recognize what they're doing well
- "You're a strong Confirmed engineer. You're not Staff yet, but here's the path."

**Don't inflate ego:**
- Don't agree with inflated assessment to avoid conflict

**Be honest and kind:**
- Reality + support = growth

## Q: What if peer feedback contradicts my assessment?

**A:** Investigate discrepancies—both perspectives might be partially correct.

**The Situation:**

**Your assessment:** "IC is strong Senior, ready for Staff in 6 months."

**Peer feedback:** "IC struggles with collaboration, misses deadlines, unclear communication."

**Or the reverse.**

**Why This Happens:**

**Different Visibility:**
- Peers see day-to-day behavior you don't
- You see strategic work peers don't

**Different Standards:**
- Peers may have different bar for "good"
- You're calibrated to framework, they're not

**Relationship Dynamics:**
- Peers may be too nice or too harsh
- You might have blind spots

**Your Response:**

**1. Don't Dismiss Either Perspective**

✅ "There's a disconnect here. I need to understand both perspectives."

**2. Investigate the Discrepancy**

**Dig into peer feedback:**
- Request specific examples
- Understand context
- Look for patterns

**Examine your own assessment:**
- What am I seeing that peers aren't?
- What might I be missing?

**3. Talk to the IC**

"I've collected peer feedback. I'm seeing some differences between what I'm observing and what peers are sharing. Let's talk through it."

**4. Observe More Intentionally**

- Join team meetings where IC collaborates
- Review communication channels
- Watch code review interactions
- Talk to more peers

**5. Triangulate the Truth**

**Likely Scenarios:**

**Peers Are Right:**
You've been missing problems.

**Action:** Adjust assessment, address issues with IC.

**You're Right:**
Peers are off base.

**Action:** Weight your assessment more, but note peer perception issue.

**Both Are Right:**
IC has strengths you see and weaknesses peers see.

**Action:** Balanced assessment, development plan addresses gaps.

**Common Patterns:**

**"Brilliant but Difficult" IC:**
- Your assessment: Strong technical work
- Peer feedback: Doesn't collaborate well
- Reality: Both true—address behavior while recognizing skill

**When Peer Feedback is Biased:**

**Watch for:**
- Personal conflicts
- Affinity bias
- Lack of actual collaboration

**Action:**
- Weight feedback based on quality of interaction
- Seek diverse perspectives
- Look for specific examples

**Prevention:**

**Make Peer Feedback Regular:**
- Quarterly collection
- No surprises

**Calibrate Peers:**
- Educate on what good feedback looks like
- Ask for specifics
