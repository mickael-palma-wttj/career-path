# FAQ: Career Progression Issues

Common questions about IC career development and progression challenges.

---

## 📋 General Career Path Questions

### Q: How long should someone stay at each level?

**A:** There's no fixed timeline—progression is based on performance, not tenure. However, typical patterns:

**Typical Ranges:**
- **Junior → Confirmed:** 12-24 months
- **Confirmed → Senior:** 2-4 years
- **Senior → Staff:** 3-5 years
- **Staff → Senior Staff:** 3-5 years
- **Senior Staff → Principal:** 5+ years (rare)

**Key Principle:** Promote when someone has been consistently performing at the next level for 6+ months, not based on time alone.

**Red Flags:**
- Promoting after only time at level (no demonstrated next-level work)
- Very fast progression without clear evidence (possible "promoted too early")
- Very slow progression despite strong performance (retention risk)

### Q: What if an IC is stuck at their level for a long time?

**A:** First, diagnose why they're stuck:

**Common Causes:**

**1. Not Performing at Next Level:**
- Solution: Gap analysis and development plan
- Timeline: 6-12 months to demonstrate next-level work
- See: [The Stuck Senior Developer case study](../CASE_STUDIES/The_Stuck_Senior_Developer.md)

**2. Performing Well but Unclear on Path:**
- Solution: Career conversation, show what next level looks like
- Provide growth projects aligned with next level
- See: [Career Conversations Guide](../PRACTICAL_GUIDES/How_to_Have_Career_Conversations.md)

**3. No Available Higher-Level Work:**
- Solution: Create opportunities (cross-team projects, special initiatives)
- Consider team change if current team too small
- Be honest if there's no path

**4. Genuinely at the Right Level:**
- Some ICs plateau at a level—that's okay!
- Focus on keeping work interesting and challenging
- Depth over breadth

**Action Steps:**
1. Have career conversation to understand their perspective
2. Review framework together to identify gaps
3. Create development plan if they want to progress
4. Be honest about timeline and likelihood

---

### Q: Can someone skip levels (e.g., Confirmed → Staff)?

**A:** Extremely rare and generally not recommended.

**Why not:**
- Each level builds foundational skills for the next
- Skipping levels creates gaps
- Sets IC up for "promoted too early" failure
- Unfair to others who progressed normally

**Possible Exception:**
- External hire with extensive experience
- Exceptional circumstances (e.g., IC built entire product that became company)

**Better Approach:**
If someone is advancing very quickly:
- Accelerate timeline within normal progression (e.g., Confirmed → Senior in 18 months vs. 3 years)
- Don't skip levels

---

### Q: What if performance is strong but no promotion budget?

**A:** Be honest and creative:

**Immediate Actions:**

**1. Be Transparent:**
"You're performing at [next level] and I'm advocating for your promotion. However, promotion budget is limited this cycle. Here's what's happening..."

**2. Document Readiness:**
Build promotion packet now so you're first in line when budget available.

**3. Alternative Recognition:**
- Spot bonus or equity grant
- High-profile project opportunities
- Expanded scope or title (e.g., "Senior Engineer, Tech Lead")
- Public recognition

**4. Timeline Commitment:**
"You'll be promoted in [specific next cycle] if budget allows and you maintain performance."

**5. Consider Retention Risk:**
If IC is flight risk, escalate aggressively for exception budget.

**What NOT to Do:**
❌ Vague promises: "Maybe next year"  
❌ Blame IC: "You're not quite ready" (if they are)  
❌ Ignore retention risk

## 💼 Management vs. IC Path

### Q: How do I respond when an IC asks about becoming a manager?

**A:** Don't immediately say yes or no—explore their motivations.

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "What's making you consider management?"
2. "What do you think managers actually do day-to-day?"
3. "What appeals to you about management?"
4. "What concerns do you have?"

**Red Flags (Not Ready for Management):**
- 🚩 "I feel stuck as an IC" (running away, not toward)
- 🚩 "Managers have more authority/respect" (seeking status)
- 🚩 "I could do my manager's job" (overconfidence)
- 🚩 Doesn't understand what management entails
- 🚩 Dislikes people problems or conflict

**Green Flags (Might Be Good Fit):**
- ✅ Energized by developing others
- ✅ Comfortable with ambiguity
- ✅ Willing to give up technical depth
- ✅ Patient with people issues
- ✅ Thinks strategically about teams

**Recommended Process:**
1. Reality-check what management is (share honestly)
2. Test management skills (mentoring, facilitation, difficult conversations)
3. Explore Staff IC path simultaneously
4. Give 3-6 months to explore before deciding

### Q: Can someone switch back from management to IC?

**A:** Yes, and it's becoming more common and accepted.

**Reasons for Switch:**
- Realized management isn't the right fit
- Misses technical depth
- Life circumstances changed
- Management opportunity was temporary (interim role)

**How to Support:**

**If IC Returns to Your Team:**
- Frame positively: "Taking on leadership experience and bringing it back to IC work"
- No shame or stigma
- Technical skills may need refreshing (pair programming, learning time)
- Leverage their management perspective

**Common Concerns:**
- "Will I lose face?" → Frame as growth, not failure
- "What level do I return at?" → Typically same level they left (or one below if was at management level)
- "Will my technical skills be stale?" → Yes, but can be rebuilt with support

**Timeline:** Typically 3-6 months to get back to full IC productivity.

## 📊 Performance and Feedback

### Q: How do I tell someone they're not ready for promotion?

**A:** Be direct, specific, and constructive.

**Structure:**

**1. Acknowledge Their Interest:**
"I know promotion to [next level] is important to you."

**2. Be Clear:**
"Based on the framework, you're not ready yet. Here's why..."

**3. Specific Gaps:**
"The framework requires [X, Y, Z] at [next level]. Currently, I see:
- Criterion X: You're at [current state], need to show [next-level state]
- Criterion Y: Gap in [specific area]"

**4. Path Forward:**
"Here's what needs to change:
- [Specific goal 1]
- [Specific goal 2]
- Timeline: If you demonstrate this consistently for 6+ months, you'll be ready."

**5. Support:**
"I want to help you get there. Here's what I'll do to support..."

**Example Script:**
"I know you're interested in Senior. Looking at the framework, the gap is in technical leadership—Senior engineers lead projects and influence architecture decisions. Your technical work is solid, but you're not yet driving direction. Here's what would close that gap: lead our API redesign project over the next 6 months, showing you can make architecture decisions and bring others along. If you do that successfully, you'll be ready."

**What NOT to Say:**
❌ "You're just not ready" (too vague)  
❌ "Maybe someday" (no concrete path)  
❌ "You need to be better" (not actionable)

### Q: What if an IC disagrees with their performance rating?

**A:** Listen, explain, but stand firm if rating is accurate.

**Process:**

**1. Listen to Their Perspective:**
"Tell me why you think the rating should be different. I want to understand your view."

**2. Understand the Gap:**
Are they:
- Unaware of expectations?
- Weighting criteria differently?
- Missing context on impact?
- Genuinely disagreeing on facts?

**3. Explain Your Rationale:**
"Here's why I landed on this rating:
- Criterion X: [Specific examples]
- Criterion Y: [Specific examples]
- Overall: [Summary]"

**4. Use Framework as Neutral Reference:**
"Let's look at the framework together. At [their level], the expectation is [X]. Here's what I observed..."

**5. Acknowledge What's True:**
"You're right that you delivered [project X] successfully—that's strong work. However, the rating considers all criteria, and [areas of concern] brought the overall rating down."

**6. Path Forward:**
"If you want [higher rating] next cycle, here's what needs to change..."

**If They're Right:**
Sometimes ICs have a point! If you missed something or were unfair:
"You know what, you're right about [X]. Let me reconsider the rating."

**If Escalated:**
IC can appeal to skip-level or HR. That's their right. Provide your documentation and reasoning.

### Q: How often should I give feedback?

**A:** Frequently! Don't save it for reviews.

**Feedback Frequency:**

**Real-Time (Immediately):**
- Critical issues (safety, ethics, major mistakes)
- Significant positive contributions

**Weekly (1:1s):**
- Ongoing performance observations
- Course corrections
- Positive reinforcement
- Development progress

**Monthly:**
- Broader themes and patterns
- Progress toward goals
- Career development

**Quarterly:**
- Formal performance check-in
- Goal review and reset
- Career conversations

**Annually:**
- Performance review
- Promotion discussions
- Compensation decisions

**Principle:** No surprises in annual review. Everything should have been discussed already.

## 🎯 Difficult Situations

### Q: What if an IC is consistently underperforming?

**A:** Address early and systematically.

**Stage 1: Informal Coaching (First 2-4 Weeks)**
- Clear, direct feedback: "I'm seeing concerns with [X]. This needs to improve."
- Specific examples
- Expectations and timeline
- Support and resources
- Document conversations

**Stage 2: Formal Coaching (Weeks 4-8)**
- Written feedback
- Formal improvement plan (not PIP yet)
- Weekly check-ins
- Clear consequences
- Continue documentation

**Stage 3: Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**
- Formal HR process
- 60-90 day timeline
- Specific goals and metrics
- Weekly monitoring
- Outcome: Improve or exit

**Stage 4: Termination**
- If PIP unsuccessful
- With HR support
- Severance if appropriate

**Don't:**
❌ Ignore hoping it fixes itself  
❌ Skip straight to PIP (except serious issues)  
❌ Lack documentation  
❌ Surprise them with termination

### Q: How do I handle a "brilliant but difficult" IC?

**A:** Address behavior while acknowledging technical strength.

**Process:**

**1. Direct Feedback:**
"Your technical work is excellent. However, your communication style is creating problems. Here are specific examples..."

**2. Clear Expectations:**
"High standards and respectful communication aren't mutually exclusive. Here's what needs to change..."

**3. Support:**
- Communication coaching
- Templates and examples
- Real-time feedback

**4. Accountability:**
- Monitor closely
- Address incidents immediately
- Hold to standards

**5. Consequences:**
"If behavior doesn't improve, it will affect your rating/employment, despite technical strength."

**Decision Point:**
Technical excellence doesn't excuse poor behavior. If they can't/won't change, they need to leave—team health matters more.

### Q: What if someone was promoted too early?

**A:** Support them to grow into the role.

**Acknowledge Reality:**
"Looking at your promotion and comparing to framework, I think you were promoted before you'd fully demonstrated next-level work. That's not your fault. But we need to get you performing at this level."

**Support Plan:**
- Scaffold their work (more support than typical for level)
- Right-size projects (achievable wins)
- Explicit skill development
- Gradual increase in scope
- Timeline: 6-9 months to grow into role

**Demotion as Last Resort:**
Only if they can't reach level after extended support period. Very difficult but sometimes necessary.

**Prevention:**
- Rigorous promotion standards
- Require demonstrated next-level performance
- Challenge thin promotion packets

### Q: How do I respond when a top performer says they're leaving?

**A:** Act quickly and comprehensively.

**Phase 1: Understand (Day 1)**
- Listen deeply to real issues
- Don't panic or guilt-trip
- Ask for time to respond

**Phase 2: Assess (Days 1-2)**

- Build comprehensive package (comp, growth, scope, recognition)
- Get specific approvals

**Phase 4: Present (Week 2)**
- Specific, concrete offer
- Honest about what you can/can't do
- Respect their choice

**Phase 5: Follow Through**
- Deliver immediately
- Monitor satisfaction
- Sustain changes

**If They Leave Anyway:**
Support graceful exit. Maintain relationship.

## 📈 Growth and Development

### Q: How do I help an IC find their "next level" motivation?

**A:** Connect their work to their intrinsic motivations.

**Discovery:**
- "What energizes you about your work?"
- "What problems do you want to solve?"
- "What impact do you want to have?"
- "What skills do you want to develop?"

**Align Work to Motivation:**
- If motivated by learning → Stretch projects, new tech
- If motivated by impact → High-visibility initiatives
- If motivated by people → Mentoring, leadership
- If motivated by mastery → Deep technical challenges
- If motivated by autonomy → Ownership opportunities

**Create Purpose:**
Help them see how their work connects to bigger mission.

### Q: Should I let an IC work on what interests them, even if it's not priority?

**A:** Balance business needs with individual growth.

**Framework:**

**20% Time (If company supports):**
- IC can spend ~20% on projects that interest them
- Must still deliver on core responsibilities
- Can lead to innovation

**Align Interest with Business:**
- Best scenario: IC's interests align with business needs
- Work to find overlap when possible

**Rotation or Special Projects:**
- If IC's interests are far from current role, consider rotation
- Or special projects that serve both

**Set Boundaries:**
- Core work must be delivered
- "Interest projects" can't derail team priorities
- Clear expectations on time allocation

**Retention Consideration:**
If IC is bored and at flight risk, investing in their interests (even if not perfect alignment) may be worth it.

---

### Q: How do I develop leadership skills in ICs who aren't pursuing management?

**A:** IC leadership is different from management leadership.

**IC Leadership Opportunities:**

**Technical Leadership:**
- Lead architecture decisions
- Drive technical strategy
- Technical mentoring
- Influence through expertise

**Project Leadership:**
- Lead cross-team initiatives
- Drive alignment and execution
- Project ownership

**Cultural Leadership:**
- Champion best practices
- Shape team culture
- Advocate for values

**Thought Leadership:**
- Tech talks and presentations
- Blog posts and documentation
- Conference speaking

**Development Approach:**
- Start small (lead team retro)
- Gradually increase scope (lead cross-team project)
- Provide feedback and coaching
- Celebrate leadership contributions

**IC Leadership ≠ Management:**
ICs lead through influence, expertise, and execution—not through authority over people.
