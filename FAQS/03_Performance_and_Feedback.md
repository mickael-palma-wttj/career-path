# Performance and Feedback

Questions about delivering feedback and managing performance discussions.

## Q: How do I tell someone they're not ready for promotion?

**A:** Be direct, specific, and constructive.

**Structure:**

**1. Acknowledge Their Interest:**
"I know promotion to [next level] is important to you."

**2. Be Clear:**
"Based on the framework, you're not ready yet. Here's why..."

**3. Specific Gaps:**
"The framework requires [X, Y, Z] at [next level]. Currently, I see:
- Criterion X: You're at [current state], need to show [next-level state]
- Criterion Y: Gap in [specific area]"

**4. Path Forward:**
"Here's what needs to change:
- [Specific goal 1]
- [Specific goal 2]
- Timeline: If you demonstrate this consistently for 6+ months, you'll be ready."

**5. Support:**
"I want to help you get there. Here's what I'll do to support..."

**Example Script:**
"I know you're interested in Senior. Looking at the framework, the gap is in technical leadership—Senior engineers lead projects and influence architecture decisions. Your technical work is solid, but you're not yet driving direction. Here's what would close that gap: lead our API redesign project over the next 6 months, showing you can make architecture decisions and bring others along. If you do that successfully, you'll be ready."

**What NOT to Say:**
❌ "You're just not ready" (too vague)  
❌ "Maybe someday" (no concrete path)  
❌ "You need to be better" (not actionable)

## Q: What if an IC disagrees with their performance rating?

**A:** Listen, explain, but stand firm if rating is accurate.

**Process:**

**1. Listen to Their Perspective:**
"Tell me why you think the rating should be different. I want to understand your view."

**2. Understand the Gap:**
Are they:
- Unaware of expectations?
- Weighting criteria differently?
- Missing context on impact?
- Genuinely disagreeing on facts?

**3. Explain Your Rationale:**
"Here's why I landed on this rating:
- Criterion X: [Specific examples]
- Criterion Y: [Specific examples]
- Overall: [Summary]"

**4. Use Framework as Neutral Reference:**
"Let's look at the framework together. At [their level], the expectation is [X]. Here's what I observed..."

**5. Acknowledge What's True:**
"You're right that you delivered [project X] successfully—that's strong work. However, the rating considers all criteria, and [areas of concern] brought the overall rating down."

**6. Path Forward:**
"If you want [higher rating] next cycle, here's what needs to change..."

**If They're Right:**
Sometimes ICs have a point! If you missed something or were unfair:
"You know what, you're right about [X]. Let me reconsider the rating."

**If Escalated:**
IC can appeal to skip-level or HR. That's their right. Provide your documentation and reasoning.

## Q: How often should I give feedback?

**A:** Frequently! Don't save it for reviews.

**Feedback Frequency:**

**Real-Time (Immediately):**
- Critical issues (safety, ethics, major mistakes)
- Significant positive contributions

**Weekly (1:1s):**
- Ongoing performance observations
- Course corrections
- Positive reinforcement
- Development progress

**Monthly:**
- Broader themes and patterns
- Progress toward goals
- Career development

**Quarterly:**
- Formal performance check-in
- Goal review and reset
- Career conversations

**Annually:**
- Performance review
- Promotion discussions
- Compensation decisions

**Principle:** No surprises in annual review. Everything should have been discussed already.
