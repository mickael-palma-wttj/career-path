# Technical Debt & Growth Balance

Questions about balancing business priorities with career development needs.

---

## Q: How do I balance an IC's growth goals with urgent business needs?

**A:** Make conscious trade-offs, communicate clearly, and prevent short-term thinking from becoming permanent.

**The Tension:**

**Business says:** "We need this feature yesterday. All hands on deck."

**IC says:** "I want to learn new technology X and work on growth project Y."

**You're in the middle:** Delivering business results while developing people.

**The Reality:**

**You can't always optimize for both.** Sometimes you choose business urgency over perfect development opportunities. **That's okay IF**:
- You're conscious about the trade-off
- It's not the permanent state
- You make up for it later
- You communicate clearly

**Framework for Decisions:**

**Assess the Urgency:**

**True Emergency (Rare):**
- Customer-facing outage
- Security breach
- Critical deadline with major consequences
- **Response:** All-hands, growth paused temporarily

**Important but Not Emergency (Common):**
- Feature needed for key customer
- Competitive pressure
- End-of-quarter goals
- **Response:** Balance with development where possible

**Artificial Urgency (Too Common):**
- Poor planning creating "emergencies"
- Everything is "critical"
- **Response:** Push back, protect development time

**Making the Trade-Off:**

**Option 1: Business Wins (Short-Term)**

When:
- True urgency exists
- Development can wait 1-3 months
- IC can still progress on timeline

**Communicate:**
"I know you wanted to work on [growth project]. Right now, we have [business need] that's critical. I need you on that for the next [timeframe]. Once we're through this, we'll prioritize your growth work. Does that work?"

**Make good later:**
- Actually return to growth project after crisis
- Find alternative development opportunities
- Compensate with high-visibility work

**Option 2: Development Wins (Strategic)**

When:
- Not a true emergency
- IC at critical growth juncture (promotion pending)
- Long-term cost of delay is high

**Communicate:**
"I know [business need] is important. Alex is at a critical point in their Staff promotion timeline, and [growth project] is essential. I'm going to keep Alex on that and assign [business need] to someone else."

**Defend to leadership.**

**Option 3: Find Creative Middle Ground**

**Integrate Development into Business Need:**
- "This urgent feature needs [new technology]. Want to learn it while delivering?"
- "Leading this effort would demonstrate Staff-level leadership."

**Partial Allocation:**
- "50% on urgent work, 50% on growth project"

**Red Flags (Unsustainable Patterns):**

🚨 **Everything is always urgent** (poor planning)
🚨 **No time for development for months** (retention risk)
🚨 **Same IC always "sacrifices" growth** (unfair)
🚨 **Growth work never happens** (empty promises)

**These patterns lead to:**
- Burned out ICs
- Stagnant skills
- No promotions
- High turnover

**Practical Strategies:**

**1. Reserve Development Time:**
- 20% time for growth projects
- Every 4th sprint is development-focused
- Friday afternoons for learning

**2. Rotation:**
- Not always same person on urgent work
- Spread opportunity and burden

**3. Make Development Visible:**
- Growth projects on roadmap
- Development time in sprint planning
- Celebrate learning

**When to Escalate:**

"We're consistently prioritizing short-term delivery over team development. Long-term, we're:
- Preventing promotions (retention risk)
- Not building future capacity
- Accruing skill debt
- Creating burnout

We need to change this pattern."

## Q: What if growth opportunities require skills we don't use (e.g., different tech stack)?

**A:** Support external learning when internal opportunities are limited—it's better than stagnation.

**The Situation:**

IC wants to develop skills your team doesn't need:
- Learn new programming language (team uses different stack)
- Explore different domain (ML when team does web apps)
- Try new role (want to do mobile, team does backend)

**The Right Answer:**

**Support their learning IF:**
- They're performing well in current role
- It's clear this is career development
- They can do it without hurting team delivery
- It's reasonable amount of time/resources

**Why Support It:**

1. **Long-term retention:** ICs who can't learn stagnate and leave
2. **Unpredictable value:** Skills you don't need today might be critical tomorrow
3. **T-shaped growth:** Breadth makes them more valuable
4. **Attraction:** Teams that support learning attract talent

**How to Support:**

**Option 1: Innovation Time (20% Time)**
- 1 day/week or 1 sprint/quarter for learning projects
- IC can explore new technologies, side projects, open source

"You want to learn Rust? Great. Use your Friday innovation time to build something in Rust. Teach the team what you learn."

**Option 2: External Learning**

**Conferences:**
- Send them to conferences in areas of interest
- Budget for 1-2 conferences/year per IC

**Online Courses:**
- Company pays for courses
- Time during work hours if possible

**Certifications:**
- Company sponsors certifications

**Option 3: Internal Opportunities**

**Cross-Team Projects:**
- Temporary rotation to team using desired skills
- Collaboration on project needing those skills

**Innovation Projects:**
- Hack weeks using new technologies
- Proof-of-concepts

**Setting Boundaries:**

**What You Can Support:**
- Reasonable time for learning (10-20% of work time)
- Conferences, courses, certifications (reasonable budget)
- Internal projects that benefit company

**What You Can't Support:**
- Majority of time on non-team work
- Ignoring current responsibilities
- Creating risk or technical debt

**When Learning Indicates Misalignment:**

If IC consistently wants to learn things unrelated to team's work:

"I've noticed you're interested in [X, Y, Z], none of which we do here. Are you still excited about the work we're doing?"

**Maybe they want to transfer teams or leave. That's useful to know.**

**The Reality:**

**ICs who stop learning leave.** Even if the learning isn't directly applicable:
- It keeps them engaged
- It builds diverse skills
- It might become relevant

**Support learning, even imperfect learning. It's better than stagnation.**
